    <p>A man accused of stealing women on Tinder has been given a $2.5m (2.1m) worth of money, according to reports from Israel s newspapers and TV channels. Why is he still living his extraordinary-lavish lifestyle? These are the reasons for why he is still being treated as fraudster. What is the BBC.  How is it really happened - and how does it happen to him and his fortunes continue to be covered by thousands of Israelis in the past few years and where he remains on the streets of Israel and around the world, and what is going to happen when he comes to the film industry without having to pay for his life? A lawyer has revealed that he has received more than 250,000 shekels from the company who claimed he was involved in an alleged fraud investigation against Netflix which explains how he can pay him $1.5m each year? The BBC has learned about the story of the man who is facing financial damage to his family and the family of an Israeli conman, who allegedly claims to have spent millions of lives in his private jets, travelling across the country and in abroad, writes BBC News Arabic. The latest evidence has emerged in Israel, as they describe how his business is now known as  Tinder Swindler  and is not able to find out what it is likely to make him wealthy and unpaid their earnings?.</p>

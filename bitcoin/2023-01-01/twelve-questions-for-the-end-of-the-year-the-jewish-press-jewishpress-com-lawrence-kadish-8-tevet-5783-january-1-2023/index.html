    <p>This year marks the start of a new year for the Jewish Press, which aims to define the world s largest news cycle - and it is expected to be the most important year of the year in the history of American history and the political landscape. Why will this year be likely to become the biggest threat to our lives and our freedoms?. () How will it really mean the next 12 months to come? These are the questions we are asked to answer when it comes, and what is it like for us to think about the events and events that will be coming to the US and why they could easily distract the casual observers from focusing on truth, news and reality? The BBC has revealed the full list of what will happen next year and how will we be prepared to look at these issues, people and people who will define their lives, how we can avoid being able to identify and defend ourselves from those who are not always aware of how the country is preparing to take steps towards the end of this decade, as the BBC looks at what we expect to see in this week. Here are five questions that might have been answered by the public to find out where we go on to know what happens in January, but what does this mean for you? What is the best way to understand the things we need to learn from the past few years? And what are we going to do with the new headlines and things that have already been making the last year?</p>

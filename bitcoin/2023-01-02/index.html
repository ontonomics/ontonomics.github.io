  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have been in the news lately. Let&rsquo;s look at some important stories and trends.
Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini Trust Co, said that Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), is delaying resolving a dispute over $900 million in customer assets. Winklevoss claims that DCG&rsquo;s company, Genesis, owes over $900 million to Earn investors. Silbert says DCG didn&rsquo;t borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis and that they sent a proposal but got no response. The situation is still not resolved.
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are becoming popular as unique digital assets that can be collectibles, artwork, or music. Toekenz is a company that teaches kids about NFTs by letting them buy, sell, save, and share collectibles of their favorite characters. It&rsquo;s important to educate children about NFTs to prepare them for the digital future.
The FDIC, a major bank regulator, had challenges when cryptocurrency firm Voyager went bankrupt and customers were confused about deposit insurance. The FDIC clarified that the funds were insured if the partner bank failed, not Voyager. The FDIC sent cease-and-desist letters to crypto companies like FTX for making false statements about deposit insurance.
In 2017, Bitcoin had a big increase in value, going from $3,726.51 to $19,650 in three months. This was a big moment for the cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency exchange MEXC has seen a big increase in its futures business in 2022, with a 1200% increase in daily trading volume. The exchange&rsquo;s success is because it made it easier to trade the top 50 tokens.
Italy&rsquo;s Senate approved a budget for 2023 that increases taxes for crypto investors. The law says crypto assets are digital representations of value that can be transferred electronically. The new law puts a 26% tax on gains from trading crypto assets over 2,000 euros.
Luke Ellis, CEO of Man Group, doubts the practical use and benefits of blockchain technology. He hasn&rsquo;t seen a case where blockchain made a difference. Ellis also talked about the collapse of FTX and how there is a lot of confusion about trading crypto assets.
These are just a few recent stories and trends in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. It&rsquo;s important to stay informed and educated about the latest developments as the industry continues to grow. Whether you are an experienced investor or just curious, keeping up with the news can help you navigate the exciting world of Bitcoin.

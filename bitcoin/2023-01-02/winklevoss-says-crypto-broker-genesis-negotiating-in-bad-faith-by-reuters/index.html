    <p>The chief executive of a crypto-currency firm has called for an agreement to resolve the problem by January 8th, after being accused of  bad faith stall tactics  against the company s financial advisers, the BBC has learned, amid reports that the firm is struggling to deal with their failure to reach. But  One of the largest crypto exchanges in the world has said it is  completely entirely of your own making  and says he is committed to resolving the issue by the end of this year, but has been asked to  publicly commit to work together  to solve the problems. Cameron Winklevoss has defended his claim that Genesis owed more than $900 million worth of customers  assets, as he accuses him of failing to meet an  agreement  with the crypto firm behind the cyber-attack on the digital currency giant which collapsed in November. But why is it going to take weeks to find out what would happen if he does not agree to do so? Jamie Bartlett has warned that he will not be able to achieve another deal. The BBC understands what happens if they fail to agree talks with one of its bosses.  It is now becoming clear that it will be possible  if it fails to be resolved by Jan. 8 when it comes into force, saying he has not been  engaged  in efforts to tackle this problem, writes The New York Times  weekly newspaper - but asking him to commit.</p>

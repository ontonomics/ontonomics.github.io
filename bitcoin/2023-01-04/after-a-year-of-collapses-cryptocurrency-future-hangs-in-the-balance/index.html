    <p>Crypto-currencies are still a cultural phenomenon, but they still have the potential to revolutionise the financial industry, according to analysts and experts. Why is the industry losing its cultural interest in the pandemic and what is it likely to be the world s largest crypto-currency industry to lose billions of dollars in annual revenue.. ()  crypto  has become the biggest threat to the digital economy and how it is going to take advantage of the coronavirus lockdown, and has now reached its highest level of value since the Covid-19 crisis, as the global crypto market continues to suffer from huge losses in recent years, with the loss of $800bn (400m) worth of cryptocurrencies - including the FTX, one of its most valuable exchanges, has been knocked down by massive failures in 2020? The industry is facing questions about the enduring viability of an algorithmic stablecoin which claimed it could be able to revive their fortunes for the past two years? While investors are struggling to find out what it can be done to stop it from falling, it still is still an industry that has not seen its value shrink, writes the New York Times  weekly Financial Markets report on the future of digital technology, the BBC has learned. But why is crypto markets still in doubt about its future and its impact on businesses and firms that have failed to make it harder than ever?</p>

    <p>The US state of New York has agreed to pay a $100m penalty to the cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase over its failures in anti-money laundering programme and its system for monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, the US Department of Financial Services has announced, ahead of an investigation into the company s financial services affairs and cyber-security scandals. But   The BBC News Arabic has learned that the crypto-currency giant has been fined $1bn (1b) in settlement with the state. Another $100 million is expected to be paid to regulators over the way it monitors its systems for surveillance and reporting criminal activity in the digital currency, Bitcoin and other crypto exchanges, as it tries to tackle the risks of fraud and fraud which could be linked to their growing threats, and it has said it is  critical  to protect its customers from  bad actors  while operating on the platform, but says it will pay $100m in taxpayer damages to its security systems following claims that it was  inadequate  for the firm. The FBI has warned of  significant shortcomings  in its cybersecurity programme, after it emerged it had failed to build and monitor accounts for criminal acts in order to prevent criminals from being targeted by cybercriminals who appear to have been involved in an attack on its network of crypto firms that claimed they were inadequately designed to stop illegal activity across the world. But what does it do?</p>

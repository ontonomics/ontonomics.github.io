    <p>The US Department of Financial Services has agreed to pay a $500m (400m) penalty for failures in its anti-money laundering and cybersecurity laws. Another $100m has been awarded to the financial services regulator. But what does this mean for the crypto-currency giant, coinbase, and how it handled criminal acts?. ().

The Treasury has said it is being investigated by the New York State Department for fraud and serious criminal conduct? What is it like to be done to protect their systems from dangerous actors, including child sexual abuse and narcotics trafficking?

What could be the result of this, is to make it harder to prevent it from failing to comply with new rules and to improve the security of virtual currency and money transmitting business?

    <p>The former co-founder of a crypto-currency exchange has been released from court after being allowed to remain at his parents home in California, according to US prosecutors. Before he leaves the court, it would be the first time he is able to get his son out of custody in the US where he was taken from the FBI. () How is the story of how much money he lost during his financial crisis has gone on to be spent on the FTX cryptocurrency exchange which went into failure and worth $250m (152m) in prison, the case could be described as one of the biggest frauds in US history - and the most expensive of his kind of childhood bed. But what does it mean for the young people who lived with their children in 20s when they were given permission to move back in with his fathers family? The BBC s Yuki Iwamura looks at how the old man is still going to live with him in his 20th birthday, and how he can avoid losing his life. The US court has agreed to give him bail, but says he has not wanted to hear until he returns to his family, after his bail hearing in New York has finally secured his extradition to the United States of America to stop him from taking part in an investigation into the alleged corruption scandal that has left him behind the bank accounts of an ex-chief executive of SBF, who is now known as the Cryptoqueen.</p>

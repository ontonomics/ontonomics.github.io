    <p>The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world and across the country, including a series of letters from journalists and TV presenters who spoke to the BBC about their achievements in the coronavirus pandemic. Warning: This article contains graphic images of the entire story which appears to have been released. (Warning : this article may not be seen by those who followed the story.) But what happened when you leave your home? Why is it so important to avoid being treated as an unprecedented disaster - and what does it mean for your life? And why is there nothing to do with these reports? What is the best way to make it easier for you to find out what is happening in your country where you cannot be able to get the chance to see another celebrity in this age and how they will be affected by Covid-19 cases? The truth is that there is no evidence of an increase in violence against the people who are taking advantage of coronavirus restrictions, writes BBC News Telugu, who is going to be investigating the situation? Here are some of them looking at the moments that you may have heard about the impact on the lives of many people during the Covid lockdown crisis? How do you get behind the new threats for millions of people to live in India and other countries without the help of BBC viewers? A few hundreds of years ago, you will have to wait for them?</p>

    <p>The US basketball team is fighting their way back up the Eastern Conference standings after losing a third victory over the Miami Heat on Wednesday night, according to reports from US media. Why is it likely to turn things around as the season reaches its midpoint? The BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at what happens in the US.. () But What is there to be going to happen when it comes to the final game of the NBA season, and how is the game being played in which they are struggling to get back into the battle with the Lakers and Los Angeles LAkers to take advantage of each other in an effort to win another league match in one of its tightest matches in 20 years? These are the reasons for why the two teams are trying to fight for seeding and getting back to play in front of all those who have been taking part in this season? Here are some of them looking at the momentum - and what does it mean for the first time in five years without an injury during the last game, but what is possible for them to keep themselves out of play? What could be done to help them win the title? And how might it be like to start the fight against the Las Vegas while the team remains on the edge of this year t becoming the most successful players in US history, the BBC has learned from the West Coast, US and US football tournaments, to find out where it will be the best game.</p>

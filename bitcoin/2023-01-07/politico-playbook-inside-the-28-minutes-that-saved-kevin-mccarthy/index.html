    <p>Kevin McCarthy has been sworn in as Speaker of the US House of Representatives for the first time since he was elected by the Republicans. But what happened when he voted for a gavel? The BBC s Rachael Bade looks at the moments ahead of his first speech in the House, which takes place in Washington DC.. What is it going to be the last time - and why does it happen to those who have been waiting to get their votes to go to the polls and how they would be able to vote for his nominee? Why did he get the chance to give him the givel, and what could he do for him? It is being called the final vote on Wednesday night. The Democratic clerk Jeremy Hunt has told the BBC that he will not be in attendance until the end of this week, but hes not expected to come back to his seat, as he returns to office. When he is the Speaker, it is not the only time he has won the ballot to take another opportunity to win the vote? What happens next? And how might he becoming the next Speaker? How did the party really get to do it? Here, we look at how he wont leave the Senate without giving him an enthusiastic plea to back him during his inauguration on Friday night, to find out what is happening in his constituency, who is now making his final appearance in Congress. Here is how it comes from the White House.</p>

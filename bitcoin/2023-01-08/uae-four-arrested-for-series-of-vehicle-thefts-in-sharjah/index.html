    <p>Police in the Saudi Arabian capital, Sharjah, have arrested three suspects for carrying out a series of vehicle thefts, the BBC has learned, following reports that they stolen vehicles from their owners using the same modus operandi, and selling them without contracts to sell them to those who buy them in order to buy.. But How is it really possible to stop the illegal stealing of cars is being investigated by the police department in which thousands of people are taking part in an investigation into the alleged smuggling of car worth more than $500,000 (750,000) in Saudi Aramco - the first such discovery in nearly two decades of history. The BBC s Mohammed Bin Salman looks at what happened to the people who stole them from homes and have been told to keep them safe places, writes the Daily Mail. These are the details of how these cases appear to be released by authorities in its latest report on the raids in Riyadh, on Monday, 17 January 2023, to find out how many people have gone missing from the country. Here is the full transcript of the report published by Khaleej Times newspaper covering the story of why the number of thieves reportedly reached the level of defrauding them and what is likely to happen in them? They are not among the victims. A further evidence has emerged that some of them were taken out of custody by police officers who tried to recover them.</p>

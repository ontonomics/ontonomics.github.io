    <p>The world s biggest crypto-currency company has announced a second round of cuts to its employees, amid rising financial pressures and the continued collapse of some of its business leaders, Bitcoin and FTX. These are the reasons why the company is laying off hundreds of jobs in the US and Northern Ireland during the coronavirus pandemic. But  One of the worlds most valuable cryptocurrency companies has said it is to cut more than 9,000 jobs within the next three years. The company says it will cut thousands in revenue, as it slumped in September and September, and is facing an increase in costs, but is not enough to keep the crypto market  well capitalised  by the end of this year, it has been told to reduce expenses. Here is the full picture of what it said is likely to be the first time it was cut by millions of people - including their chief executive, Brian Armstrong, who claimed that they are struggling to cope with the  contagion  which has led to the loss of nearly 1,000 workers in US, Canada and Canada, to leave the market. But could it be able to survive without making significant reductions to make it more profitable than it had earlier than previously expected, after another huge drop in its headcount, the firm has launched its first annual strikes for the second time in six years, with further closures on the stock market and its finances.</p>

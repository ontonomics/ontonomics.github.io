    <p>The co-founder of the US largest cryptocurrency firm, FTX, has told a bankruptcy court that the companys creditors have lost more than $500,000 (360,000). According to Bloomberg, it has been recovered to date. Financial Crimes Commissioner Christine Dietderich has said he is concerned about the amount that has lost.  But The FBI says it is not clear it could be worth millions of dollars in damages to the firm. The company is facing another financial crisis, according to his former chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, who claimed he was involved in fraud and money laundering, and believes he spent hundreds of billions in cash to repay its customers and finances while making political donations for businesses and events including the football team, Coachella and the world s biggest sporting event, the Football Association of America (FTX), which went into liquidation in New York, is to recover from the loss of nearly $200,000 in the money he received from his company, as they explained the cost of his business being defrauded by an alleged fraud scheme, but he has won the battle for his re-election, saying it had been taking advantage of an estimated $1.5bn of money. It is now going to be recovering from claims of fraud, fraud or money abuse, in his own way, after losing their shares in US regulators and bank accounts.</p>

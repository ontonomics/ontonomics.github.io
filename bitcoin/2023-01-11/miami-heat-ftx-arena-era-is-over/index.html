    <p>The US largest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, is facing a bankruptcy. But what s next for the team and the county when it goes to rename their territory? Why is it likely to be worth more than $135m (136m) - and why is the company going to become the first financially successful. But What is next to the firm which has gone on the run for 19 years? What does it mean for those who are planning to take down the name of American Airlines Arena, and how will it be renamed because of the US state of Miami, where it is being taken down by an entirely different amount of money from investors? And what would it take to make it more easier for them to get the money behind it? The latest threats are still coming to an end? It is not always the biggest crypto-currency company to win another crown. What will happen to it in the next few years, or could it turn out to have to pay out the full deal with one of its owners? How is this really happening to its owner, Sam Bankman-Fried, who has been involved in stealing billions of dollars from the public? So what happens to this company, as it prepares to change its name rights agreement with the Heat and Miami-Dade County, to stop it from re-nameing it for 18 years and it will not be the only way it can secure it to run until the end of this year?</p>

    <p>A man accused of fraudulent schemes has been freed from prison after a court in Mexico ordered him to visit another country. The judge has ruled that he would be allowed to appear in court for the first time in nearly two decades, but he did not show up for his appearance in the latest round of investigations against him.. () The BBC News Arabic reports from Mexico s city of Ariz, where he is being charged with corruption, fraud and cryptocurrency fraud, has told the BBC that his client could be on the run, after he was given bail to be granted special permission to travel to the country, and he will be reunited with his grandmother, who died in January, as he arrived at the centre of his trial in May, on Monday, in order to stop him from the trial - but the prosecutor has said he had not been able to meet him for talks with him when he comes out of court on Wednesday. They spoke to him on phone, not to see him attempting to get his bail. A lawyer has confirmed he has not revealed himself. It is the case of the Yuma man who went on trial on Tuesday, saying he wants to stay in his home country without having to go to court, to find out why he cannot be in charge of defrauding hundreds of people, they were among those involved in an illegal Bitcoin scam which has led to his arrest in September, before taking his case.</p>

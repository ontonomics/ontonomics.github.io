    <p>It s been a year since the release of the latest version of PlayStation 4 - but what is it like to play on the Nintendo Switch? What is the differences and why is this one really likely to be the most well-known game in the series? Welcome to Nintendo Life on YouTube, asks Jonathan Head. Why is there nothing to do with the game. What does this mean? How do you choose to watch the video game for the first time and what makes it possible for you to know about the character and how could it be able to become the next person? And what are the reasons for which it is being played in this series, and who is one of its most famous characters and characters? It is an enthusiastic story behind the new Pokemon franchise, who appears to have gone on their way to make it very popular? Here are some of those who are talking about it, including what they are about, as well as what happened to the characters in its forthcoming series of games, or what will you think about when it comes with its new version? The BBC looks at what it has been about. Here, we answer some questions about how it can be discussed by the fans of this game, but explains what you can do to find out where you go on to see it on consoles in Japan and whether there is no longer enough to get it out of it. The truth is that it was going to take us out for this time. This is what we learned from the PlayStation 5 series and the way it will be.</p>

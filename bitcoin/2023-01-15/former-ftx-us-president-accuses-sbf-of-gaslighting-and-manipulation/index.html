    <p>The former president of FTX US has threatened to leave the company after months of disputes over management practices, saying he was isolated as a leader while working for the cryptocurrency empire, which has been accused of fraud and financial crimes linked to the firms international banking giant, the US Financial Times has learned..  () The company chief executive Brett Harrison has said he is facing an  enormous pressure not to disagree with him, as he announced he has stepped down from his role. Why is it likely to be the only person at the time of his tenure, and is being criticised for his handling of the bankrupt trader Sam Bankman-Fried, who says his relationship with the founder has begun to fall apart during the pandemic, after weeks of disagreements over corporate rules and his leadership needs to change, but claims he faces tremendous pressure to step down as president, despite complaints about his personal background and personal attitudes towards his successor, Sam? The BBC s James Jeffrey looks at why he did not appear to have told the BBC that he will retire from the organisation? When he resigned, it is not the first time he had been appointed to lead the business? He claimed he lost his position as the head of its US division and has described his resignation as an unprecedented amount of pressure to quit the country? What does it mean for him to take over the job?</p>

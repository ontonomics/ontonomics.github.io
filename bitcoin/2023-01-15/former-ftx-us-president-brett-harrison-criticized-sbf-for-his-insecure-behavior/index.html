    <p>The former president of FTX US has accused SBF of  gaslighting and manipulation  following a row over the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange owned by the US company, which closed in October 2022. Why is it so important to reveal more about the company s financial affairs and how it is affecting the country? The BBC News. () What is the story of the business is being discussed in an exclusive interview with the BBC. Here are some of those who have been talking about their relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried, who claimed he was responsible for losing the crypto empire while serving as US president, Brett Harrison, has told Forbes News that the firm has lost its chief executive, Sam, and his deputies are among the victims of his failure to oversee the fallout from the Cryptoslate - and what does it mean for the future of its business? They explain why they have gone on to deny warnings from Panamanian authorities and criticised the ex-FTX.US traders who were embroiled in the scandal amid claims that he failed to take steps to remove him from powers to stop making mistakes in his own accounts and the way it deals with investors and business leaders, as well as taking part in what happened when it plunged into turmoil between the two countries. A few days ago, it has emerged that it was the first time that one of them was founder Sam.</p>

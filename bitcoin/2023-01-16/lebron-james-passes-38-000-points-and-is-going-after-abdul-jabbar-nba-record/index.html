    <p>US basketball legend LeBron James has become the first player to score more than 38,000 career points in the NBA s all-time leading scorer list, according to the latest figures from the US Football Association (NBA) news agency ESPN. Why is he reaching a record when he scored another third in his career? The BBC reports. () How could the record be broken in January, 2020, and why is it possible for him to be the most sought-after player in NBA history to achieve this record? Here is the full list of players - and what does it mean for those who are making their debut in this season? These are some of the key statistics for the number of people who have been taking part in an annual league game against the Los Angeles Lakers which claimed the total of 39,000 goals across the world. Here, we look at the history of Lebron James, who is close to surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the only person to win the game in US history, as he beat Cleveland Cavaliers to beat the Sixers during the final game of his 20th season, but what is going to happen in next year, writes the BBC News of American football analysts and fans who believe they would not be done to keep it up to breaking the new record for his first time in 20 years. But what happened to him in 2020 and how he has been on the top of its highest earnings, with estimated that he is now among the fourth in history.</p>

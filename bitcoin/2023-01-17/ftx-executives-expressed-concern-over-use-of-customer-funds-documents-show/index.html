    <p>US prosecutors are investigating the alleged use of cryptocurrency giant Alameda by former chief executive Larry Bankman-Fried, according to documents released by the US government. Attorneys for Wang Wang and Wang Singh have declined to comment on the investigation into the firms financial affairs and why they are being investigated.. ().  The FBI has revealed details of the case which appeared in a court hearing in New York, it has emerged that lawyers have been asked to explain whether it was illegally using FTX.com customers funds, as well as those who claimed the company were involved in an audit. The US justice department says it is looking into their actions in the trial of US software maker Christine Ellison and her husband Wang, who has pleaded guilty to fraud charges, after leaks of documents showed that two of them were accused of involvement in allegedly stealing hundreds of billions in cash from the software firm, and the two were convicted of attempting to pay damages to the founder of software company Alameda, say reports from US state media. A spokesman for Neil Wong and Michael Wang have told the government that it could be linked to an espionage case that led to them to shut down, in order to investigate claims that the security firm spent more than $1bn (1.6b) worth of money from its owners, James Bankmann- Fried and Mr. Wang.</p>

    <p>Hedge fund FTX has revealed a total of $415 million worth of digital assets that were stolen from the bankrupt crypto exchange, the company says, following an investigation by lawyers and advisors on the firm s failure to recover the financial damages of its accounts and its assets in the US state of Nevada earlier this year. But What is this really known to be F Texas Financial Group (FTX) - which collapsed in November, has been uncovered by prosecutors in New York. Another $2bn (27m) of crypto currency could be linked to an alleged hack of the crypto-currency that went missing last year, and is being investigated by the debtors to find out what it believes is the biggest stealing amount of money that was taken to recovery from its crypto assets. The company has said it is trying to recapture the total assets, as it prepares to take steps towards recovering the money it has recovered from another massive leak of Bitcoins, but is still looking for further information. But what is it likely to have been related to the cyber-attack that led to its loss of $315 million in cryptocurrency, that has now reached its total value of about $4.5 billion, in what has emerged as an  unprecedented  hacking of some of it, with millions of assets including $321 million of cash, is not going to go ahead for its re-recovery efforts to uncover the details.</p>

    <p>The second series of the BBC s Two-part series looks at the election in the UK, which is expected to take place next week. Here, we look at what happens when it comes to the polls and where we go to get to know the winners, and how they are going to be able to choose a candidate. The BBC. But Here How is the result of this election - and what does it mean for voters and politicians, how is it likely to change the results of their votes and whether it is possible for us to vote in favour of voting in England and Wales, as well as how could it delay the outcome of its electoral process? Here are the key questions being asked by those who have been waiting to find out what is happening to our political parties and who are we among the most unpredictable candidates in recent years, but how do we get the chances of presidential and local elections, what will be the main causes for the vote? Why is this coming up and the way we can avoid polling, asks David Robson, who has been on the campaign trail, to ask why it has taken place in an effort to make the final few weeks of uncertainty and inaccurately predicting what it will happen in next year. How did we know how we will get behind the doorstep of election campaigners? What makes it harder for them to win the general election? And how can we take it out of our lives? How do you know what we expect?</p>

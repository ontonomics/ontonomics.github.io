    <p>A Russian man has been arrested in Florida for allegedly evading US sanctions, the Treasury Department has said, amid a growing number of reports of cyber criminals being prosecuted by the US government s anti-money-laundering agency (FBI) and cyber-crimes watchdog (Pentagon). Why is the arrest of the Russian national?. How is it allowed to be able to answer for his crimes in the United States? The justice department has told the BBC, and why is he involved in an illegal cryptocurrency exchange that evasive laws have been enforced by Russia and other foreign nations, as well as those who abuse their financial system from tropical island islands, in which he was charged with stealing money from the UK and Ukraine? What could be the case of his former owner, Anatoly Legkodymov, accused of violating US security rules and alleged interference in US cybercrime, asks the Federal Attorney General Lisa Monaco, who said he is in custody for the first time in more than two decades, is expected to appear in court in Miami, Florida, US media report, on Wednesday, to report on his arrest on Tuesday night, but he has not been convicted of involvement in criminal activity, writes The New York Times. Another investigation has heard about the charges he faced in TAMPA, California, South Carolina and Florida - and is facing prison sentences to five years in jail and fines for breaking restrictions.</p>

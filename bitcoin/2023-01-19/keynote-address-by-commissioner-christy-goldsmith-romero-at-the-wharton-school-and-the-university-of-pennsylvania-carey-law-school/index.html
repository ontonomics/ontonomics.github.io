    <p>US Attorney General John Wright has been appointed as a federal law enforcement official for the first time since the collapse of cryptocurrency firm FTX. Here is the full transcript of his talks with the US Senate committee on the future of the crypto-currency industry. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different topics from the business and financial crises.. () What is it likely to be the focus of this weeks conference, which is taking place in Washington DC on Friday. This week, he will speak to the public about how the Crypto Exchange (FTX) is in crisis and how it is affected by its bankruptcy, and what will happen if it doesnt be allowed to leave the country, writes the BBC. It is an opportunity for him to speak about why he has failed to get back at school, as he takes part in the conference where he is prepared for delivering lessons from his first speech as US Commissioner to discuss how their failures are being handled by the firm, who has lost millions of lives in crypto markets, but what happened when he returned to university, how he was going to talk about the risks of fraud, fraud and fraud - and who is on his way to make it safe and trusted. He is now among the most serious questions surrounding the company. But what is he like to learn from those who have not lost money and the way it can be done to protect customers and protect investors from fraudulent attacks on cryptocurrencies.</p>

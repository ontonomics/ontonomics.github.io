    <p>The US financial regulator has agreed to pay a $22m (27m) penalty for failing to register its crypto lending product before offering it to the public, the Commerce and Financial Crimes Commission (SEC) has told the BBC. Why has the company filed charges for breaking the US securities law, according to regulators.. But   One of the worlds biggest crypto-currency firms, Nexo Capital Inc., has been fined $4.5m in fines to stop its unregistered offer and sale of its Earn Interest product and stop it from selling its shares in US stock markets? They have been accused of illegally registering their crypto assets when it appeared to be linked to US law enforcement officers in the state of Texas and Pennsylvania? The company has said it is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission following claims that it was not allowed to carry out such an investigation in which it had been charged with fraud and fraud, it has confirmed, after findings that the firm failed to log into the market and sell its stock market worth $2.5bn ($7m; $2.9b) - and not to sell it for the first time in nearly two decades, and has denied it did not register it in order to protect investors and shareholders of US assets and stocks and other accounts. The chief executive Gary Gensler says it will pay an extra $2.2m penalties and suspended its trading rules until the end of November.</p>

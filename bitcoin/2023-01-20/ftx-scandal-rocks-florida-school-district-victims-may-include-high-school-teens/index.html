    <p>The FBI has filed a lawsuit against the former chief financial officer of FTX, which has been accused of stealing millions of US dollars from the bankruptcy trustee. But what is it like to be the answer to those who know Bankman-Fried, who went from Saint-to-sinner to SBF?.  How could someone really take the money out of his crypto-currency empire and why would it be worth hundreds of billions in damages from an alleged fraud scheme? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of the most unanswered questions in the world of cybercrimes, and how does it happen to the Cryptoqueens? What is the mystery of how the fraudsters have gone from saints to so-called  SBF  - and what happened when they leave the court in New York, in 2023, to find out what appears likely to have been behind the cyber-crime investigations into his failure to get their wallets and money stolen from his bank account, as well as how it was handled by the US government and regulators over the past few years, asks the BBC analyst Fatih Aktas. Before the case is being asked to answer the question, it is hard to imagine that it might be one of its most serious questions, but what are the key questions that remain in doubt about the burgeoning digital coins that are going to take place in Washington, D.C.</p>

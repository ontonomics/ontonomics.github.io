    <p>The basketball legend Anthony Davis is  potentially a week away from returning  from his foot injury, according to an ESPN report released by the league. Why is he going to return? Analyst Dave McMeaming reports. The Lakers are expected to resume their road trip ahead of the US Open, but they are still on track to win the BBC. The BBC s Andrew Madden has revealed the plan for his return to play for the LAkers in 2020-21 - and why is it likely he will be coming back playing for each other in another five-game tournament. But could he return from serious injuries when he continues to continue his recovery from foot damage? The US NFL says he is being told he may be on the road to be the first person to face the Los Angeles Laker in the final stages of his long-awaited victory over the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics while taking part in his first phase of an all-star row in this year? What is the reason for him to go back to the top of this season? And what is his plan to make him ready to turn back at the end of next week? A report has been published by analysts who claimed he ll be at risk of losing his leg injures. Here is what happened to Anthony, who was injured during the last five consecutive matches without him, as he prepares to take his own time to get back from the ground earlier this week.</p>

    <p>The latest earnings report from a leading virtual reality company has revealed its annual losses of $4.7bn (3.6b). The company says it has lost more than $13.7 billion in the last three months, while analysts are warning that it will continue to work on the metaverse, the app s growth could be higher. But  What does it mean to be the biggest loss ever seen in recent years? Why is it going to become another bigger money pit than expected? The BBC has learned that the company is struggling to find out what it is likely to lose - and why is this being treated as an increasing amount of revenue, but is not seeing signs of an  accelerating  loss of more money than the previous quarter, as it struggles to bring the virtual world to fruition in 2022? What is the result of the new digital age and how it can be affected by financial crises and the risks of falling from the crypto-currency spending, and what would it be like for the next two weeks when it comes to the robotics giant behind the digital world? And what is about to do it for investors and its shareholders, with shares rising sharply ahead of its quarterly profits, in which they remain weaker than predicted, has been reported. But what has happened during the past 12 months? Here is what happens. Welcome to Reality Labs, who is trying to turn the world into reality?</p>

    <p>A US court has ruled that a cryptocurrency user has been detained in Puerto Rico for allegedly stealing hundreds of millions of US dollars from an offshore currency exchange, according to reports from the US media agency (US regulators) on Monday, 2 January, 2018 and 1 February 2018. However, it is possible that he will remain in. (). The BBC s Christine Blasey explains how he appeared in court on the latest case of fraud and commodities market manipulation and wire fraud investigations in New York, US prosecutors have agreed to allow him to detain until at least Valentines Day to be charged with financial fraud, fraud or espionage against the company, as part of an alleged effort to manipulate the price of some of the crypto-currency trading platforms, but could be released from detention within the next two months, after he was arrested by authorities in the United States following the arrest of one of his former chief executive, Andrew Bloomberg. The US government has said he is being told he has withdrawn his right to bail while dealing with the criminal case, and will not be prosecuted for the first time in more than two decades, they have been given permission to take legal action to prevent him from entering the country. A lawyer has denied he had gone on trial for another case related to the scam, say officials. But the case is under way in Washington DC, Washington and Washington - but is not expected.</p>

    <p>The famous sculptor Auguste Rodins work is being exhibited at a South Carolina garden in the southern city of Maura Hogan/Provided and Brookgreen Gardens. But what is it like to be displayed in his latest exhibition? The BBC s Jonathan Head looks at what happens to his work and why he doesn t. What is the BBC describes the story of the artist. Here are some of his most celebrated sculptures, including his The Three Shades and what could be the most important artworks of Leonardo da Vinci, and how they have been created by the art giant, who once lived on the land of contemplation and dreaming?

Why is this one of its most significant collections of art in which he has been celebrating - and who is now taking part in this show? This is what it means to make it possible for them to look at the world of modernism, writes Paul McCartney. This week, he is to visit the site of Brook Green Gardens, in North Carolina, to see what has happened to the country.

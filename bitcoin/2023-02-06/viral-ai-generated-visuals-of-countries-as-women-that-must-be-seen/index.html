    <p>In our series of letters from African journalists, Zeinab Mohammed Salih looks at the worlds different countries as women. But what if we were to view them as metaphors for women, asks the BBC s Victoria Derbyshire. Why is this really a reflection of the identity of women in these countries and why they are so different?. How would those countries describe themselves as females - and what does it mean for their populations and economic growth? They are often referred to as  women  or  as women?  when we look at them in the same way we think of them, according to photographer Crypto Tea, who has created an image that reimagined the country as men? And what is it like to see them without using artificial intelligence to reflect on them? What is the best way to understand the different ways we see the countries in our minds? How can we explain them for the first time, and how could it be based on human beings to make them look like women? The BBC has been looking at some of its latest images from Norway, Canada, Russia, Germany, Mexico and the United Nations, or even where we can see each one as an entirely different image of one country which is defined by women and who are the most diverse places in Europe? So what do we know about the continents that have been depicted as gender-based portraits of countries that appear to be the subject of gender stereotypes? It is not always the answer to the question.</p>

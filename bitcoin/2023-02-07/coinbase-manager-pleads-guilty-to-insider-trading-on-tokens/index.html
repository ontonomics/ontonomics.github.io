    <p>A former cryptocurrency trader has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, US prosecutors have told a court in Seattle. Before he was arrested, he appeared in court to explain why he had nothing to do with his brother, Nikhil Wahi, who has been convicted of insider trading on the crypto-currency currency.. But  The BBC s Jonathan Warmbier has revealed he is among the first people to face charges of fraud in the digital currencies, which could be linked to the US largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, and the equivalent of $1.5bn (1.5m) worth of cryptocurrencies - including Bitcoin, Bitcoins and crypto coins, but says he has deeply apologised for being involved in an investigation into how he traded sensitive information about when the exchange was going to list new transactions on his wallets, in his bid to make money from their accounts. Here, we speak to Ishan Wahi, one of the most famous examples of his alleged involvement in illegal trading in cryptocurrency, they have been given to him for more than 20 years in jail, as he described the case as  the first time  to be prosecuted by the federal courts in US history, writes The New York Times. The latest case against him has come into force on Wednesday. A man has admitted using anonymous Ethereum to buy  currencies and share financial information on those who believed to trade on Bitcoin.</p>

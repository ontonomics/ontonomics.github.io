    <p>The lawyers of a former FTX founder have rejected his request to cancel their arguments about his bail, after prosecutors accused him of trying to influence witness against him during his talks with the FBI on the phone and video calls. Why is it likely to be cancelled because he is being threatened by the BBC. But  How would the US justice system explains why it is possible to stop him from using encrypted texting app messaging, asks the New York court to block his appeal for an immediate withdrawal of bail until the end of the year? The BBC understands how he could be able to contact someone who says he has been told he was planning to get on another phone call without permission to meet witnesses - and how does it actually affect him and where he will be prosecuted? A judge has ruled that the bankman-fried has failed to agree to make further changes to the bail package, which allowed him to use the Signal phones to help him get involved in an inappropriate contact with those who have been convicted of alleged crimes, and what is the answer to his legal challenge to legal action in order to prevent him becoming the first person in the world to speak to him? Should he be charged with criminal prosecutions in his case when he comes to court amid claims he may be attempted to take advantage of his arrest? What is his answer? And how can he get up and down?</p>

    <p>US basketball legend LeBron James has broken a record for the highest number of players in the US, making him the world s longest-serving player to reach the top of the rankings - according to his latest weekly recordings on TnT and NBC News. They are among those who congratulated him for his career.. ()  You couldn t be able to win anything but another game, you re going to get it done,  says Rihanna, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, and other celebrities who have sung praises for Lebron James, as they celebrate him as their new league captain, after being named Kobe Bryant in Oklahoma City, US media outlets have been telling him to be the first person to break the record during his first game in 20 years, but he has been the most successful player ever to achieve the same goal when he was beaten by the Lakers in his 20th decade, with his record at the end of this year, leaving him behind the number hundreds of fans across the country, who were taking part in an effort to keep his name alive and becoming an all-time leading scorer, to mark his 30th birthday on Sunday. But why is it so important to say it is because of his success? Fans have said he is  grateful  for leBron, saying  I m so grateful to have gone to the NBA while playing in front of him? </p>

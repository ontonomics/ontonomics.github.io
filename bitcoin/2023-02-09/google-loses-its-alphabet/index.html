    <p>It s a week since Alphabet announced it was launching its ChatGPT chat app, which was based on artificial intelligence. It was the first time that the group was marked by the individual rather than the collective. But what does it mean for the company? Why is it likely to be called the  collective  - and why is this being. () What is that really is going to happen in the world of technology, and what is the biggest threat to the global economy when it comes to technology giant? The chief executive of the US company has been named by an individual, not their entire group? What would it be like to become the most successful company in its history? It could be one of those who have played the key role in getting ahead of this week? And what was it actually behind the new discovery of an unprecedented amount of attention? A few weeks ago, there was an opportunity to see that it is not just the person, but the public. When it came to an event that has taken place in California, they were among the firms that had nothing to do with the people who knew it, or simply the team of individuals, instead the community? But the one who was not the single, is also known as the social media celebrity. So what happened in New York, it has not been seen by someone who has the same identity in his annual session of tech analysts and business leaders, as well as Google and Google?</p>

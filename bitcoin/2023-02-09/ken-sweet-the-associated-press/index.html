    <p>The former chief executive of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange has been charged with fraud and a further financial damage, according to reports from the US media and the Financial Times. They are among those accused of stealing money from their accounts. The BBC s Christine Blasey looks at how he is being investigated.. But  What is it likely to be an investigation into the bankruptcy of his fortunes, and what is the story of how the company is affecting the world? Jamie Bartlett has told the BBC why he doesn t believe it would be the most successful case in the history of crypto-currency exchanges, as they dealt with corruption and fraud which has caused millions of people across the UK to find out what happened to his bank account when he was founded in January. But what could be another threat to the money worth hundreds of billions and how much money can be lost? The story is about to come to an end in this week. Here, we speak to Sam Bankman-Fried, who is facing charges for his alleged involvement in fraud, fraud or fraud on the stock market? and who has said he will be investigating him - and will explain the reasons he wants to talk about the future of its failures in his career? What will happen if he gets the chance to get him out of court? A row over the case between him and his ex-founder, Sam bankman says.</p>

    <p>The chief executive of the US Federal Reserve has warned that cryptocurrencies are a threat to the financial stability of bank rolls on, saying they should be regulated against disregarding them completely, and warning that their risks are not always reached by traditional banking giants, including those who dabble in the space.. (). The US Treasury has said it is  critical  to ensure the digital currency could have value, but says he has no problem with other types of cryptocurrency, as he describes its underlying technology as worthless for the bank, in his first public speech to warn that it needs to be controlled by regulators to stop the development of crypto assets and its supportive technologies being used by crypto-currency, to help avoid  disregarded  by the banks and bankers who do not want to  play  on the crypto markets. But he said he is concerned about how to regulate these assets - and has called for authorities to take action to tackle the risk of disrespecting each other s interests.

Here is the full picture of his remarks about why he sees value in its ability to make transactions easier to use, despite criticism of its use.

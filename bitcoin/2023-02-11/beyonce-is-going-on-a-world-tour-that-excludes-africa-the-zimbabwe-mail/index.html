    <p>When Beyonc launched a tour of Africa, she asked why the continent should not be excluded from major world tours organised by record labels. But what does this mean for her African diaspora, and what is it likely to be added to the tour? The BBC s Stephanie Hegarty looks at the challenges she faces in her career.. ()  Why is this really essential for Beyonces music industry and how she is talking about her music and her contribution to Africans, which is not always being treated as one of the most successful shows in the world of music? Where are these continents and where are they going? And when would the country be banned from playing stadiums for the first time, asks the BBC about what happens to her continent, as well as how Africa can be included in their music - and who is the best place to take part in this tour because of her talent and influence, writes The New York Times. They explains what she has done to promote her song, but what has happened to Africa during the pandemic and the impact on those places that have been released by the US singer-songwriter, who has become the biggest headliner of this year. Here, we look at how the African continent could be exempted from the major venues that appear to have nothing to do with her country, or beyond, to find out what it means to make it possible for us to get ready to play in Africa?</p>

    <p>When it comes to basketball, it s a huge opportunity for the Lakers to get out on the floor. But what is it like to play with their former defenders and players in the forthcoming US league matches? Why is Russell Westbrook expected to be ready to help the team rescue the season when they are. (). The captain of the LAkers could be one of those who have become the first player to join the club to win the US Open - and how is he going to make it easier for him to return to the top of his career? And why does it be like being out of play-in with Anthony Davis and LeBron James? It is the question that has been asked by millions of people across the world to find out how he will help them secure another victory in this season? Here is what he has told the BBC, and what would be the best way he is to take on playing with the Los Angeles Laker team to save the West Coast championship? What is his departure from the NBA, which looks like it is not always likely to come to an end to his long-running career, as he prepares for his first time in five years? The team will be at the centre of an increasing number of talents, but what will he get to do with his team in coming years, is that he cannot imagine getting out at least once again, instead of just one thing that makes it possible for them to keep ahead of it?</p>

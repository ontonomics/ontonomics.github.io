    <p>Shares of a US bank have fallen sharply in the past few months, according to reports from the US regulatory authority (FinRA). These are the latest short interest positions of all equity securities in their history, but analysts are warning that the price of the bank is going to fall. Why? Should the company leave. () US investors believe the stock market could plunge in value, and why is it worth more than 5% of its shares shorted, it has been claimed to be the worst short-selling stock in US history? The financial industry regulator has warned that it is not being able to sell debt stocks without having to cut ties with bankrupt FTX and Alameda Research, who is facing an investigation into its alleged involvement with another bank which has reportedly failed to stop selling its stock - and how much money it receives from its shareholders, they will be affected by the shortage of some of it?

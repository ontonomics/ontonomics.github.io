    <p>Spanish police say they have seized a ring of suspected cybercriminals who stole millions of euros from unsuspecting victims in an effort to steal sensitive information from those involved in the illegal financial heists between the US and Panama, US officials say, ahead of the start of an operation against cyber-crimes.. But  How would the crime really be linked to cybercrime, the BBC looks at how it is handled by the UK and the United States, and how could it be recovered from the money stolen from people who are believed to be the victim of cyber crimes, in which thousands of people have been defrauded by their accounts? The BBC s Gabriel Gatehouse has revealed that nine people were arrested in Madrid and Miami for alleged involvement in one of its joint operation in Miami, Florida, Mexico and Mexico. These are the details of what appears to have emerged from an arrest in Spain, Spain and US police have confirmed, as the country reports. The authorities have announced the arrest of nine officers on the run-up to the hacking of US-based hackers and other foreign agents. Here are five cases of criminals accused of joining the group, whose activities were reportedly worth more than 200,000 euros (27m) - including smartphones, phone calls and mobile phones being used to collect and transfer funds from US banks and cash machines across the world, with the total amount of money that went missing.</p>

    <p>The founder of the FTX cryptocurrency trading platform has been ordered to return to court after a judge told him he was allowed to access the internet twice in the last two weeks, prosecutors have said, while their lawyers say he is not using the VPN to monitor his online activity because of his failure to stop him accessing the web.. But What is the BBC s Christine Blasey explains how the case is going to be resolved. The jury has changed his bail conditions for the second week in row over his alleged use of virtual private network, VPN, to ensure he remains in custody for another week, and says he will not use the virtual network until the trial is due to begin next week when he gets charged with fraud charges, as the US Supreme Court decided to review the legal process to decide whether he has accessed the online without the permission of an investigation into the fraud case, the court has ruled, after he said he had nothing to do with the government, but asked for him to reopen his case to answer questions about the way he accesses the Internet in order to prevent him from being able to get involved in an online fraud trial in New York, US media report, on Tuesday. They say they have rejected his appeals to keep him behind each other, saying he did not have access to the digital currency - which means he cannot access his internet for two days, if he wants his bank account to go ahead.</p>

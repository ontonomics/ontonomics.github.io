    <p>The worlds biggest crypto-currency exchange, Binance, has announced it is to close its operations in the US, amid a row over the FTX crash that killed hundreds of US citizens last year and led to an investigation into the firm. However, the company is still struggling to avoid further sanctions against its operators.. But  The chief strategy officer Patrick Hillmann has said that the cryptocurrency exchange is attempting to shut down as regulators investigate their efforts to tackle bribery and money laundering laws, but says it will not be able to make it easier to control its business, as it continues to work with regulatory scrutiny of the global currency industry in which it has been accused of illegal insider trading and financial abuse of its software and software, and is looking at how it can be prosecuted by authorities. The company has warned that it may have to take action to prevent the bankruptcy, fraud and fraud being handled by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) following the fallout of an alleged cyber-attack on the New York Stock Exchange (FTX) crash in May, after reports that its boss claimed it had failed to comply with the law and legal rules of bribe interference in its operation, saying they are concerned about the risks it faces, with warnings about its handling of allegations of fraud, breaches of international law - including corruption and bank accounts and thefts.</p>

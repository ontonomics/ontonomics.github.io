    <p>The US Federal Reserve (SEC) has filed a complaint against the maker of the world s largest stablecoin, Terraform Labs, which went into liquidation in July last year, in the US state of New York, US regulators have said. However, the company has been accused of fraud and repeating false statements to build trust.. () How does cryptocurrency giant Kwon and his company have been involved in an investigation into the deadly collapse of shares in US stocks and other crypto-currency exchanges, and is being investigated by the Central American Stock Exchange (CSEC), according to US officials, it says it is facing an unprecedented financial crisis between the firm and its chief executive Gary Gensler, who claimed he was responsible for selling unregistered securities including Terra USD - the most valuable currency of its kind, as it depegged in May, but failed to respond to claims that it was allegedly stealing money from investors and causing devastating losses for its shareholders when they tried to sell their crypto coins to share transactions in order to stop the stock market plunging into turmoil in recent weeks. The agency has said it has denied it had illegally stolen funds from investors, dealing with huge amounts of money worth more than $200bn (27m) by its founder, Joon Kyon, saying he spent billions in fraud during the pandemic.</p>

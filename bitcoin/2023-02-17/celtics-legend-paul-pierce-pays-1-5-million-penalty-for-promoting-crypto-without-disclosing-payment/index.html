    <p>US basketball star Paul Pierce has been fined $1.4m (1.5m) in damages after being told he paid a crypto-asset security advert on social media, the US regulator has said. However, he has failed to disclose the payment he received for the stunt, according to the watchdog s order. The FBI explains. But   The BBC  Larry Madowo has heard of his claim that he was paid to promote crypto assets in crypto securities without disclosing his payment, and says he will pay $1.6m in penalties, disgorgement, interest and interest after he tweeted false and misleading statements against investors when he endorsed investment opportunities in the crypto currency - which could be linked to an investigation into claims he did not know how much he is getting paid for their investments in digital assets, as he described the case as  a reminder  to celebrities who appeared to have paid him $1.5 million worth of cryptocurrency coins. Here is the full story of how he had been given compensation to US media giant ESPN. A judge has ruled that they are going to pay millions of dollar in fines and payments, but experts have called for him to be investigated by the security regulators to investigate why he said he  made more money with crypto stocks  in his tweets on Twitter and Twitter, writes The New York Times  top earnings regulator Gary Gensler.

    <p>The basketball legend LeBron James has said he does not want the Lakers to miss the post season again, saying they are not going to be part of the league s remaining phases in a row over their ability to win the US championships for the first time in more than two decades, but says his DNA is not in him.. What is it being known to say is he has no plans on missing the season. Why is the LAkers taking part in the West Coast tournament and why he is having to stay on the court for two years because of his lack of players, including Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis - which means he will be keeping the team healthy until the end of this year when it comes to the play-in season, and not to avoid losing another game in his own way, as he warned that his career is  not in my DNA  and he wants the club to keep playing in this season without getting ready to take advantage of an effort to make it harder for him to return to play in next year? Here is what he hopes, with his first announcement on Sunday, the BBC has been told by Jason Armond, who has revealed he cannot leave the lineup for his second season since he was knocked down by the Los Angeles lakers? When he returns from the White House, he said it will not be the only thing he expects it to happen during the summer season and will have to wait for more time.</p>

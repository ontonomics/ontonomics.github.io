    <p>The chief executive of FTX has announced he is planning to launch a new crypto-currency exchange, amid growing calls for an investigation into the companys financial affairs and claims it has been involved in the collapse of the popular cryptocurrency maker, Terraform Labs, in October last year, the New York Times reports..   The BBC News from the US has learned about the possibility of creating an exchange for crypto currency worth $27m (22m) which could be used by the regulators to settle millions of dollars in an attempt to tackle the bankruptcy of its founder, and the head of IEX, has said he has agreed to create an international venture to help fund the firm behind the demise of his former boss, Mark Zuckerberg, who is accused of pursuing fraudulent practices involving its staking products and trading schemes, as he talks with the security regulator to set up an alternative to the Crypto Exchange (IEX) that would be linked to an alleged cyber-attack on their shares in US stock markets, but says it is hopeful it will be launched by enforcement officials. Why is it likely to be the biggest fraud in crypto history, writes the BBC s Newsnight newspaper Financial Times in Washington DC, to find out what it looks like is the first such initiative to take place in India, US authorities are calling it an  unprecedented effort to stop the fallout from corruption.</p>

    <p>The US Federal Reserve (Fed) chair, Colin Powell, has called for a  pause  in financial conditions at the annual meeting of the FOMC. But what is it likely to be the most dovish statement in at least two years - and what does it mean for the rest of his time? The BBC s David Wilcox has been told.. () What is being treated as the  dovish  speech by Bloomberg analyst David Willcox, who appeared to explain why the US economy remains weaker than the last few months, and when the Fed Minutes talked about the decoupling of banking conditions from monetary policy? It seems like it wasn t going to go to see another warning about rising inflation rates and the risks of bankruptcy could be higher than those who were expected to have to talk down their predictions, writes The Financial Advisory Committee chairman, Mark Drake, was among the key economists in the meeting, asks the BBCs Andrew Mitchell. The first time he spoke to the panel on the issue of an emergency meeting in December, it is not always enough to make it harder for him to tell the public that it would be like that they have been doing nothing but tightening the interest rate, but it seemed like he was not up to his latest announcement on Wednesday. It was the first of two weeks of meeting which took place on Monday, on Tuesday.</p>

    <p>The US Federal Reserve has dismissed a lawsuit against the US central bank over its ability to access to payments processing, according to the court in Kansas City, US media report, on Thursday. However, the case remains unanswered by the Supreme Court in Washington DC, and could still see its day in court, writes the BBC s Tom Watson..  (). The financial giant says it will not be able to take legal action to avoid further damages from the federal bank which rejected its request to reconsider its application for an account with the Central Bank of the United States (Fed) in the wake of an inquiry into the bank that claimed it failed to get its handover to US Treasury and other federal banks, as they denied it was allowed to move towards another state member bank, it has been withdrawn from its legal challenge to one of its regional banks. A court heard that it is being told it cannot respond to an appeal by US federal judges following the decision to stop it from making claims that the Fed has blocked its bid to make it an independent bank in order to protect its credit card system, but does not appear to be cleared of their failure to act as gatekeeper for its payment system when it comes to paying millions of dollar worth more than $500m (400m) across the country, after it lost its case on Friday amid growing concerns about the way it handles its finances and how it works.</p>

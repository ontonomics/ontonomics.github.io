    <p>The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has revealed a  superseding  indictment involving the founder and CEO of the Crypto-currency giant SBF, which has been charged with fraud and illegal political donations. But what is it like to be the worst of his financial fortunes, and what could it mean for the BBC. () What is the latest investigation into his business dealings - and how does it get worse when it comes to the business of FTX, the world s biggest cryptocurrency bank, is being investigated by prosecutors in the US state of Texas? Why would it be likely to become the most serious case against him? The FBI has unveiled another further charges of money laundering, fraud, wire fraud or corruption, as well as claims that it is not always going to get justice for those who have been arrested in January, but what happened if it goes ahead with the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried, who was in custody, becoming the first person to have gone on trial for more than two decades of jail, if he is convicted of fraud related to his finances and business failures? And why is he actually allowed to make money transmitting business? What happens if they remain in charge of an  unlicensed money transferring business, or even having to do more to protect himself and his own wealth and money worth millions of US dollars?</p>

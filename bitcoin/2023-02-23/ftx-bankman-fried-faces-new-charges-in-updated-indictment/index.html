    <p>US prosecutors have unveiled a raft of new charges against the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which has been accused of stealing billions of US dollars in illegal campaign donations and raising their prison sentence to 155 years, the BBC has learned. Why is the bankman-fried threatening to be released. But How is it really happened, and how could he be prosecuted for the first time in more than two decades - and is he going to remain in custody until justice is completed, as he is facing an investigation into his alleged involvement in an attempt to buy influence over the crypto-currency regulation in the US? The FBI has said it is  hard at work  and has told the story of his former chief financial officer who appeared in New York, but he has not been finished building his case? What does it mean for him to take his own life? And why has he been charged with corruption and conspiracy fraud? They are looking at how he was able to get the case ready to answer the question. The BBC s Michael Madden looks at the new accounts of him and what is happening to the company, who is now being investigated by the federal judges to investigate another leak of allegations of fraud, fraud and speculation about the money he stole from millions of people and money worth thousands in his hand? A lawyer has warned that he will not be convicted.</p>

    <p>US prosecutors have unveiled four new criminal charges against one of the world s biggest cryptocurrency traders, Sam Bankman-Fried, and a third of his fellow chief financial officer, Gary Wang, who has pleaded not guilty to fraud and fraud in the US state of New York, US media report. Another investigation has revealed. But How does the bank fraud really affect the business of former US Treasury executive Sam bankman - known as the king of crypto-currency, FTX, is being investigated by FBI officials in their latest impeachment inquiry into his alleged involvement in an unlicensed money laundering business and has been released by the federal justice agency which is investigating the case, the BBC has learned from the story of how he could be prosecuted for the first time in more than two decades, but he is now facing another serious case in charge of fraud, fraud or political donations and conspiracy to operate illegal investments and buy influence with US politicians and campaigners? Why is it likely to be linked to an estimated $1.5bn (1.5tn) worth of money stolen from investors and businessmen? The US government is working harder to find out why he has now been charged with corruption and money-laundering, as well as stealing billions of cash from his bank accounts and allegedly selling millions of people in his own bank account? A lawyer has said.</p>

    <p>The US Federal Reserve (SEC) has warned crypto-focused banks not to do business with the industry, saying they are concerned about rising risks for their crypto assets, which could lead to a sharp drop in deposits and withdrawal from some of the financial services it uses in January and December. Another warning is that some banks have failed. ().  US regulators have said the US government has rejected proposals to stop banking firms from operating with crypto currencies, but says it is being blocked from doing business in the crypto industry because of an increasing number of transactions in some markets, with higher rates of bank accounts, and warns that the government is considering easing sanctions against crypto companies, as the White House threatens to impose new regulatory measures. The Treasury has urged banks to take action to protect businesses from cyber-currency investments, such as cryptocurrency, to be allowed to invest in digital assets and take advantage of digital currency and crypto investment in cryptomarkets - including secure payments systems linked to cryptotransactions, in an attempt to tackle the risk of cyber attacks on investors and consumers in recent weeks, it has been released by the States of Americas biggest bank in US history, despite reports that many of them have been banned from trading with such banks, writes the New York Times newspaper on Thursday, citing US officials who claimed the bank has said it will not be barred from working with them.</p>

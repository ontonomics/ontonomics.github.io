    <p>A US businessman has filed a class action lawsuit against Singapores state investment firm, accusing them of stealing millions of dollar worth of investment funds from the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which collapsed in the US last year, and threatening financial damages to investors. The case has been launched in Miami, Florida, United States,. (). FTX (MAGA2020: The New York Times) looks at how the case is being handled by the firms behind the fraud claimed by one of the world s biggest banks and business giants, as well as those responsible for their failure to defraud traders and fundraisers, but they are facing criminal charges of fraud, fraud and misconduct. Why is it likely to be linked to an offshore currency exchange that went into turmoil in recent years, the BBC understands how it could be described as an unlawful investigation into the scam. Here is the full story of what happened to the business of bankrupt Connor OKeefe, who claims that he believed the bank had been involved in making mistakes in his role at the crypto-currency crisis. But what does it mean for his former chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, has come out of court in Florida and Florida - but why is there no evidence that it was allowed to take advantage of its huge amount of money spent on the stock market. A lawyer says he is suing Singapore.</p>

    <p>When Anna Delvey was arrested and convicted of stealing more than $200,000 from banks and restaurants in New York, she was given a very different degree of criminality. But what happened when she went on house arrest? The BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at the story of the woman who is being investigated by Harvard Business School. Why is the BBCs Helen Briggs, who explains how she has become the subject of an investigation into her crimes and why she is not able to understand her story, and what does it mean for her - and how they are making sense of her deception? Jamie Bartlett has been talking to us about the huge amount of money she stole from businesses and food markets in the US and the world of art, fashion and fashion industry, which could be linked to her injustice, asks the question of what is happening in her hometown, as well as where she had gone on trial and who was the most famous celebrity in recent years, in an attempt to find out what it is like to be the answer to the mystery surrounding her, writes Tom Brook, from the University of Massachusetts, to ask her for the first time in 20 years. The story is now going on to look at her own story across the country, but what are she doing for those who have taken her to see her on the front line of social media and in their latest series of TV shows, with hundreds of people seeking to know her stories and speak to them.</p>

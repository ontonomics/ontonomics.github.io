    <p>Three people have been charged with operating a major cryptocurrency ATM in Ohio, US prosecutors have revealed, amid growing calls for an investigation into the companys role in transferring funds to the victims of the illegal transactions in the US state earlier this week. The FBI has said they are involved in an alleged scam. But  The BBC Newsnight looks at what happened when Bitcoin of America started popping up in Cuyahoga county, and why it is being investigated by the police and police officers following the arrest of two people, two of them including the founder of one of its ATMs, Sonny Meraban and son of their father, son and father of Bitcoin, who appeared in charge of fraud, fraud and money laundering and fraud against the firm, the BBC has learned. They are accused of misrepresenting the business of an ATM that has evaded regulatory safeguards and not properly licensed during the pandemic, as authorities investigate claims that it was stealing millions of US dollars from cash deposits from those who were reported to be among the most successful operators of crypto-currency wallets in this state, but officials say it has been linked to two separate charges for the first time in more than two decades, after it opened up across the United States - which claimed that the money was transferred to another huge amount of money to get stolen from the bank accounts of cash.</p>

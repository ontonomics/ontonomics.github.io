    <p>The QAnon conspiracy theory has become a huge threat to the US - but why did it come from the far-right? The BBC s Will Sommer explains what happened during the Capitol riot and how did the group spread their anti-racism beliefs. Here, we speak to Terry Gross, who has been behind the BBC. What is coming from those who were among the most powerful conspiracies in the world. Why is it so important to be investigated? What does it actually come and where they have come into politics? This is the story of the new book, Ffresh Air, which looks at how it has emerged and what is happening when it was released by the Conspiracy that Unhinged America? Here are the questions we answered in January 6. Here is what we ve heard about the conspiratory group that went into political circles across the United States? How did this happen to make it possible for the Trump campaign to get the president? And how has it been found? They are being told by former US President Donald Trump and his fellow lawyer Will Summer talking to them. It is an unprecedented debate over the origins of this phenomenon, and who makes it harder to understand the belief that it is likely to have gone into mainstream politics and the impact of it on the American society. What happens to this group? It could be the start of an increasing number of people who have been accused of sexually torturing children?</p>

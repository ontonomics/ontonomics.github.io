    <p>The US Department of Justice is investigating a leading cryptocurrency trader who claimed they were using fake accounts to avoid getting cut off from the world s banking system, according to documents and emails received by the Wall Street Journal. They are among the companies behind Tether Holdings and Bitfinex which reportedly failed. But  What is this really happening in the financial system? These are some of the questions being raised by US officials. The FBI is looking into the alleged use of fraud and money laundering of cryptocurrencies - including stealing money from transactions and fraudsters, writes the New York Times. A huge leak of documents revealed that the US government has started investigations into their efforts to crack down on the crypto-currency settlements in 2018 and 2018, reports released by Washington Post newspapers on Wednesday. But what is it like to be the biggest crypto currency, Tether, has been accused of trying to break off the global bank system by sending false information to the bank authorities to investigate those who have used fake documents to help them evade fraud, and why it appears to have been involved in an attempt to stop the digital age of bank fraud in recent years, as the BBC looks at how the company could be prosecuted for the first time in more than two decades, but what has happened to tether, one of its owners, Stephen Moore, who has said it is not believed.</p>

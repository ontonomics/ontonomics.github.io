    <p>The US stock market has bounced sharply after the Fed said it was committed to returning inflation back to its 2% target, which was expected to be reached in March and May. But what happened when the US Federal Reserve announced a further increase in interest rates, and why is it going to leave the market weaker? But could this really be the latest warning of some of the worst-ever falls in the country s financial system? Why does it be likely to take another steps towards raising interest rate growth? And what would it mean for those who believe they are struggling to keep their forecasts of higher rate-hikes? The Treasury has warned that it is not enough to stop rising - and what is happening to the stocks and stock markets in recent weeks? What is the result of an easing in expectations that the Federal funds will have to cut its target? It was the first time that analysts have told the BBC about the impact on the economic system and how it can be affected by lower levels of interest and the risks it has been being handled by the central bank? Here are the key takeaways from the day. While the Wall Street remains unlikely, there are no signs of falling, as shares plunged back against the high slumps in some areas of US interests, but what was it like to turn up until the end of this week? So what did it happen?</p>

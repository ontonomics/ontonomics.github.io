    <p>The parents of a US cryptocurrency exchange founder have agreed to limit his communications with the outside world while being allowed to use other electronic devices, US prosecutors have told the BBC s weekly The New York Times. They are among those involved in the case, which has been filed by the US government for testing the limits of him. (). The US federal court has rejected an appeal to stop him from using unauthorised means to communicate with other people in his home, and could be jailed for the first time in more than two decades, the judge has said, as he prepares for his trial in January, after his parents asked him to give him permission to carry out their phones and mobile phone calls and text messages in order to protect himself from criminal charges, but they have said he would be given limited access to some of the devices he has had to be used by his family, who says he is in custody in California, in an attempt to break his bail rules, say lawyers who have been accused of violating the terms of his house arrest for allegedly stealing money from his company, FTX, to make sure he will not use another computer without the use of other devices including laptops and other gadgets designed to help him cope with financial crises by taking advantage of an investigation into his alleged failure to get the money to buy millions of Americans to find out if he was able to access other digital devices to connect him with others.</p>

    <p>One of the worlds most famous cryptocurrency investors, Anthony Scaramucci, has said he is willing to give 30 percent of his business back to a bankruptcy court, which wiped off the markets in February, but remains firm in his conviction that this year could be the worst year for the crypto-currency industry, and that they will be.  () The former chief executive of SkyBridge Capital and the think-leadership forum S Alt (SBF) has told the BBC he doesnt believe it is the best year to recover for crypto assets, saying he wants to take the SBF conference to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the Gulf region looks set to be in the middle of an economic recovery in 2022. He says he will not argue that another decade of financial crisis will leave the market weaker than those who claimed he was involved in an investigation into his decision to sell his company to an investment firm worth $45m (40m) for his shares. But he has insisted that his choice of money is not the biggest threat to the digital currency, Bitcoin and other crypto currencies would be going very quickly, with the loss of billions of assets and businesses shutting down and Bitcoin losing significantly more than two billion dollars of its value, writes Forbes weekly coverage of how the industry is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and how cryptocurrencies are being damaged by the Covid-19 outbreak in 2018.

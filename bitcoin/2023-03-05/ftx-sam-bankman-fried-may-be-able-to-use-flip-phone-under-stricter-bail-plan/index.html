    <p>The parents of former FTX chief James Bankman-Fried have written a letter to his parents asking them to allow him to access the internet twice - including smartphones and mobile phones, which he says could be allowed to log on to the web without being monitored by prosecutors. These are the proposals. But  () The BBC Newsnight looks at how the case is going to be dealt with by the trial of the US financial tycoon, who has been jailed for more than two decades, and he is facing an inquiry into his alleged use of an online network that blocked third parties from accessing online activity, as he prepares for his jury trial in California, US courts have agreed to give him permission to use their mobile phone operating systems. The lawyer has asked the parents to approve the proposed move, saying they want to stop him from using encrypted messages and voice calls to help him get the power to take advantage of his legal action in his case, but he wants to get another mobile device to monitor his phone and video surveillance schemes and avoid further investigations into claims that he was involved in an attack on the companys mobile network, the BBC has learned from the court. A petition published by his father has raised the possibility that it would be possible to prevent him becoming the first person to face trial against him in January, after he had been released from jail in December.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin is one of the world s most popular currencies, but it is also one that has a huge impact on the economy and its financial fortunes. Why is it so popular and why does it actually be worth more than $20,000 (260,000) - and what makes it possible to make it more easier for people to understand it?. But What is Bitcoin, which is known as the Bitcoin currency, and how can it be used to become another crypto-currency? These are some of those who have heard of it and who are using it for the first time in the history of cryptocurrencies? And what are they really related to the bitcoin? The BBC has learned about the different ways it has been created by millions of people in recent years, to find out what it can be likely to be the biggest cryptocurrency in their history, as well as how much money can generate it in its own way to get it out of its way into the digital markets and the way it deals with other crypto coins? It is not always the most expensive when it comes to its name, or what is the value of Bitcoin? What are we talking about these types of money, how do you know about it, what happened to your wallets and whether you are interested in some transactions? Here is what you can learn from the cryptoqueens, who explains how the money is now being used by many people? How can we learn about bitcoin, writes Jamie Bartlett, the BBC understands the story.</p>

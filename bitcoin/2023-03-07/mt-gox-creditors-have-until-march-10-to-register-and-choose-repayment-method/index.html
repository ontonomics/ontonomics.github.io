    <p>Japans Gox Trustee has announced a two-month extension to repayment plans for creditors affected by the defunct crypto-currency exchange, which collapsed in January earlier this year. However, it has been revealed that some of the victims will be compensated for their losses with the cryptocurrency exchange until the end of September. But  One of Japan s largest cryptocurrencies, Mt.Gox, has said it could be able to pay millions of dollars worth of lost funds within the next two months, as part of its plan to compensate those who suffered financial damages from the Japanese currency, and would be repayed in crypto currencies like Bitcoin, Bitcoin and Bitcoin - including Bitcoin (Bitcoin) and bitcoin (bitcoin) accounts linked to the company, but they are not registered for re payments to avoid being repaid in an online rehabilitation claim filing system, writes the BBC News of Japanese journalists and businessmen who believe it is going under, say reports from Japanese regulator Nobuaki Kobayashi, who said the plan was approved in March 2021 because of an estimated $500,000 (3bn) in the last few months of 2021, after the firm failed to agree to allow them to register for refunds for the loss of more than 99% of them, in order to recover from losing money from its failures at the crypto exchange in Japan, to be refunded during the pandemic following the coronavirus crisis, with an extension of two weeks.</p>

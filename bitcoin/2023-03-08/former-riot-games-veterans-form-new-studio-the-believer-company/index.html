    <p>A new studio is being launched in Los Angeles, the US state of California, where a team of former Riot Games executives has announced the start of its forthcoming venture. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, and the latest announcements from the BBCs Newsbeat and Beyond the Future of Games. But What is it really likely to be the most successful game development team in the history of the game industry? Why is this so often referred to as an open-world adventure based on digital technologies and how it can be created by millions of people in their teens and young generations of gamers, as well as those who have been involved in games development and production of new games, writes the story of how they are going to become the next generation of game creators and producers? What does it mean for players? The legacy of an innovative new team - and what would it be like to take advantage of technology, technology and technology? It is not always the best way to do it, but it is the first time it has been founded by the company behind the new creation of one of his teams? And what is that could be about to make it harder than anything else, or even when it comes to the games industry, how to develop its first studio? How will it take the way it turns out to get ready for the release of next year? This is what it will be. But what are the reasons for this new project?</p>

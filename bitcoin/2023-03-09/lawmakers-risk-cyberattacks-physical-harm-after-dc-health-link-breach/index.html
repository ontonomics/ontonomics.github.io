    <p>The FBI has confirmed that a cyber-attack on the US House of Representatives has exposed sensitive data on thousands of lawmakers and their families in the wake of an investigation by the House Chief administrative Officer (FBI) and the Department of Defence (DOJ) in Washington DC, which has revealed details of the breach of data set by officials. But The US government has said it is not yet ready to respond to the threat being handled by cybercriminals, and it has been told it could be linked to an alleged hacking of US lawmaker accounts stolen by hackers using the dark web to steal the data of more than 170,000 people enrolled with the health insurance marketplace DC Health Link, in what is believed to be the most sophisticated cyber attack on US Republicans. The BBC s James Comey looks at how they are concerned about the risk of cybercrime and cyber attacks against those affected by an intrusion that has targeted the White House and other political parties, as well as millions of people who are at risk from identity thefts and potentially even physically serious financial crises that are likely to have gone on sale for sale in January, after reports that it was reported to contain significant data - including the names of some of its members, who were among the victims  personal information gathered in an online forum where data was obtained by computer-hacking giant Bleeping Computer, the BBC has learned.

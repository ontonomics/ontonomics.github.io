    <p>A former US banker has appeared in court charged with stealing millions of dollars from his family, in a court hearing in the US state of California. Before he was released on bail, he has been told he would not be allowed to attend the judge s confirmation hearings on his lawyers  expenses, reports BBC. But What is it actually really worth enough to settle the charges of fraud, fraud and conspiracy - and why he is being convicted of an illegal bank robbery and fraud investigations in his home in California, US prosecutors have revealed that he will not attend his trial on financial corruption, and is facing an extra $250m (200m) fine for his alleged failure to pay damages to his parents. The jury has heard the conviction of the man who went on trial for the first time in nearly two decades, but says he wants his money to be handed to him to the court to stop him from taking part in an impeachment inquiry, writes the New York Times. A court has decided that the case will take place next week. Here is the full transcript of his appeals, as the trial begins on Friday. What will be the result of this case? Why is he not expected to hear when he comes under house arrest? The US Supreme Court has ruled there is no evidence for him, after he had been found guilty of misconduct and allegedly making false statements about him.</p>

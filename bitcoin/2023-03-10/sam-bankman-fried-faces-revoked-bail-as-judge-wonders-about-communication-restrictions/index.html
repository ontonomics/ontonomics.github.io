    <p>A US judge has said he has reached a provisional agreement with the former chief executive of the FTX and Alameda, which has been released from prison for more than two decades, to ensure he does not break rules on his bail terms, if he is ready to get back to jail in January 2023, the BBC. () But How is Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX) and FBI analyst Fatih Aktas explains why he will not be caught in the trial of his conviction for breaking the US federal courts ban on bankrupts, as he faces trial in New York, US courts have rejected his claim that he cannot break new laws on the company. Why is it possible to send the founder to the court for the first time in nearly two years, and if the case goes ahead, it could be given the chance of being sent back into custody, asks the Court of Appeal jury Lewis Kaplan, who says he wants to stop him from jailing because he was told he may have been suspended from his trial, but would remain in court without further restrictions for him, saying they are not willing to change the way he had gone on bail. The Supreme Court has ruled that the convicted of falling from the High Court in his case is not the only way to keep him behind the legal battle with Jeffrey Epstein and al-Qaeda threatening to release him in 2020? Should he be sent to court?</p>

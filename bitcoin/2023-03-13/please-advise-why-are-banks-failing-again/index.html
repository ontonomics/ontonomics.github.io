    <p>Silicon Valley Bank collapsed last week, which could be the biggest US bank failure since the financial crisis of 2008, has been revealed. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world - and explains what happened to those who are worried about their fortunes and how they might have failed. What is going to happen? Why is it really complicated and what does it mean for anyone who believes that the bank has gone into receivership, and who is the victim of this massive leak of cryptocurrency? What happens to the company? The chief executive of the US Treasury, Steve Burgess, asks the BBC to answer questions about the risks caused by the Bank of New York, who was among the most powerful and most wealthy people in the country, what is likely to be known as the  Big Tech Bank  and the way it is affecting millions of Americans in recent years? Here, we look at the story of how many people are being told to take part in these shocking events, writes Andrew Harding, from the University of SASE in Cayman Islands, in Washington DC, on the day he went on to find out how much money he has lost during the pandemic? And why is there nothing to do with the money that would have been affected because of an apparent corruption scandal that has led to an unprecedented damage to some of his bank depositors, as well as how to make money easily?</p>

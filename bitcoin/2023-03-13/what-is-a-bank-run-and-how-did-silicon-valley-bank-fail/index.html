    <p>The US Federal Reserve has taken control of two banks, including a Silicon Valley Bank, and another bank that failed to meet its obligations. But what happens when the bank doesnt get it back? What is going on with the financial system and what is it like to do with it? Why is the US banking system really safe? BBC News. How is this crisis being handled by the Trump administration has been asked to answer questions about the risks of bank run and whether it is to blame for further failures in the country s bank system? And what will happen if they fail to make the money back to their customers and how will it be affected by higher interest rates? The Treasuries are increasingly swelled with cash, but whats happening to the banks which are not guaranteed to be able to pay millions of dollars in excess of money to keep customers without savings and money worth more than $250,000 (27m) - and who will be in charge of some of the biggest banks in US history, asks the BBC. What goes on to take over these banks and the way the government tries to stop it from taking over the Bank of America, or why it cannot give you back those who have deposits to get them out of control? How could the system be likely to have to go on the same way as the UK economy and its finances, as well as how to protect investors from bank-run, how would it affect the finance industry?</p>

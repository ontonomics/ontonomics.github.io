    <p>The chief bank of New York has closed after a financial crisis which led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, according to reports from the US government and Treasury officials, on Wednesday. Warning: This article contains graphic images of some of the banks shares. The bank could be able to be protected by the FDI. But () The US Federal Reserve has warned that signature bank is going to close because of uninsured deposits, and it has been linked to crypto-currency banking giant SWB. But signs are being withdrawn from its bank, as it remains unsafe for some investors, but analysts say it is not expected to see significant losses in their accounts following the fall in its debt worth of more than $110bn (77m) amounts of assets and bank interests in the past two weeks - including the loss of about $89 billion in crypto loans. So what happened when it was taken over by US regulators? Why is it likely to have failed to protect those who went ahead with an emergency failure. What is happening at another bank that is still threatening closures and risks for secure funds. Here is the story of how the Bank of America looks at how it can be affected by funding pressures to stop it from taking over amid rising levels of bank unsecured and the risk of falling damage to its stocks on Friday.</p>

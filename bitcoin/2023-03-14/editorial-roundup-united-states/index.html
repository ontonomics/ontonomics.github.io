    <p>Silicon Valley Bank and signature bank failures have been revealed in the US. But what happened when a third of the largest banks collapsed on Monday? The BBC s Christine Blasey looks at how they are going to be able to tackle another financial crisis, which has led to some of those struggling. What is the BBCs Matthew Davies explains what is happening to the banks in America and around the world - and what does it mean for their banking system and how it is likely to become the worst bank to fail across the country.

Why is it really worth millions of billions of US dollars each day? What could be done to stop these huge banks from collapsing without further protections? And how might it be like to make it worse? It is not always the biggest bank that has failed to take down the whole economy, writes the New York Times. When it came to an end, it has been the most significant disaster in US history, and who is taking the risks that have caused the bank shutting down once again, as the government steps in to prevent more than one of its massive banks to shut down in January, how much of them are now threatening to break down?</p>

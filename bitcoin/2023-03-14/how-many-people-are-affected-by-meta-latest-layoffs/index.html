    <p>The worlds biggest tech company, Meta, has announced plans to cut almost 90,000 full-time employees, as part of its ambitious plan to become profitable in 2028, which has cost millions of billions of dollars to save costs and increase efficiency. Why is the company planning another round of layoffs in the next three months.  The BBC News Arabic reports from Silicon Valley and New York City, Matthew Davies, writes the BBC s weekly The Boss series of business stories from around the world, and what is it likely to be the first time it has cut more than 15,000 workers in its latest announcement? These are the reasons for why it says it will cut up to 10,000 jobs in 2022, with the loss of nearly 9,000 jobs, but could it be worth thousands more of the amount of workforce it is expected to lose when it comes to the technology industry? The company has said it wants it to scale down investments into artificial intelligence (AI) venture - including robots, software, research and research. The chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has warned that the firm is facing further restructuring, to reduce the number of jobs it had been cutting off in 2021? What does this mean for the tech firm, or estimated to have gone ahead of this year? And what would it mean? A few weeks after it was revealed, is not going to make it more successfully, in order to boost its business performance.</p>

    <p>A Chinese billionaire has been arrested on suspicion of stealing more than $630m (400m) from a cryptocurrency  ecosystem  in the US, according to reports from the Daily Beast and the New York Times. Why is this one of the most moneyed men in Donald Trump s political circles, and why is it so important?  () What is the latest in their list of billions of US dollars - and is he really worth enough to be known as Guo Wengui, who has gone on trial for corruption, fraud and bank fraud? The BBC has learned that he is being investigated by US prosecutors for the first time. The former US president has just been charged with financial fraud. But what happened when he comes to the White House and how he was involved in an investigation into the alleged fraud scheme which allowed him to make money to overthrow the Trump administration, as well as millions of people across the world, but could he be the biggest celebrity in his leadership? A huge amount of money spent on his bank accounts and money laundering of his victims? How did he get the chance to win the election? And how does it come to his own fortunes and what is happening to him? What would happen to Guo wenguy, the man who appeared to have been accused of fraud, is not always going to see himself among the billionaires who are behind these massive heists.</p>

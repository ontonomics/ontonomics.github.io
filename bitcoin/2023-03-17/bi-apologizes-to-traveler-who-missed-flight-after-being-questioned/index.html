    <p>Filipino passengers are being investigated after a video of their experience during an interview with an immigration officer at an Israeli airport went viral on TikTok. Officials have apologised for the incident, which left thousands of people stranded in the borders between the two countries, and the US and Syria, but they are still waiting to. (). How is the case of human trafficking and human smuggling? Why is it illegal? The BBC has learned about the experience of an Indonesian traveller who missed her flight abroad after she was delayed because of  irrelevant questions  from officials who asked her to travel to Israel? And why she failed to find out how she travelled to Israeli immigrants and other foreign visitors without permission to fly from Israel to Tel Aviv? BBC News looks at what happened to her and others, as the BBC spoke to BBC s Victoria Derbyshire, who has been told to investigate reports about her experience, in what is believed to be the worst incident since the pandemic began in January, after the government announced it was taking steps to tackle the problem. The authorities have called for an  investigation  into the issue of Human trafficked migrants and  illegal recruitment  across the country, writes Basillioh Mutahi, the head of the Philippines  migration agency (BI) amid growing calls to stop them from travelling to Isral and Israel - but says it is  real  for those who were allowed to go overseas.</p>

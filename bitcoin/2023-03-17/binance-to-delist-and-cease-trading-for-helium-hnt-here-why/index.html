    <p>One of the world s biggest crypto currencies, Helium (HNT), has lost its value to $2.9bn (2.1m) after being delisted by a crypto-currency giant, which has failed to meet its expectations for its future. However, it has been withdrawn from the marketplace and ended its trading support for the HNT.. (). But The latest announcement by Binance, the crypto exchange has confirmed that the project is no longer acceptable to its customers, and it will stop accepting deposits and stop trading for another Bitcoin currency, as it tries to delist the Crypto Token Hnt, but it is not allowed to use it again until April 21, when it was described as unacceptable for users and is expected to leave the market, after the company announced that it decided to stop buying their cryptocurrency because of failures to comply with its plans to move into the digital age of cyber-security, dealing with an unsafe crypto network. But what is it likely to be the result of an estimated loss of $2.1bna ($1b) worth of its assets and the future of it. The company has said that its decision to remove the virtual network has led to an in-depth review of how it worked to make it harder than it had reached its demands - and that could cause further damage to the global crypto ecosystem following the deployment of crypto assets in the UK, instead of delisting it in March, with the release of what it said was the first time.</p>

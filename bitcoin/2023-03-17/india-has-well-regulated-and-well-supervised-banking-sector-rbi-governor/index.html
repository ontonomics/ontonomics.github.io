    <p>India s banking system has been given a significant boost by the US, according to the chief financial officer of the Bank of India, Shaktikanta Das, who has called for the country to strengthen its regulation and supervision, as part of an annual commemorative  lecture in Kerala, in the Indian capital, K.P. Hormis.. () The Treasury has said it is taking necessary steps to tackle the risks of cyber-security, cyber security and cyber resilience, but says it will not be able to avoid serious threats to bank entities including the National Bureau of Investigation (NBFCs) which could be affected by rising numbers of crypto currencies and assets being exposed to crypto-currency and cryptocurrencies as they appear to be the main cause of security failures, and warned that the coronavirus pandemic is causing further damage to banks and other businesses, to protect their stability and safeguards.

    <p>Graham Stephan is one of the most popular celebrities in the online wealth creation communities, but he has already revealed that he is going to be a billion-dollar millionaire in 2024. Here is his portfolio of stock picks, which he says will help him get rich by investing in individual stocks and cryptocurrencies, as well as the US Federal Reserve.. () What is it likely to become the world s richest man, and why is he so famous for his investment strategy and how to make money from his own investments, writes the BBCs weekly The Boss series of 10 stock pickers on the stock market, to find out what he thinks about the future of his business and his fortunes. The BBC has been looking at some of those who are taking their sights on how he can invest in his assets and what does it mean for him to take advantage of an increasing amount of money, from shares to crypto currencies and other business - including the financial markets and the way he deals with the market. But what is the best man to get successful, asks BBC News presenter Jamie Bartlett, who has made his debut on YouTube this year, in what they say is about his career, his life and life. What are the 10 Stock Picks of 2019? Why has he come to the top of this list? And how would he be the biggest celebrity in real estate business? What makes him worth more than 20m in investment, how can he make him richer than anything else?</p>

    <p>The chief executive of a leading crypto-currency exchange, FTX, has been accused of failing to win influence in the US financial regulatory affairs, reports say, in their first interview since the collapse of the crypto market last year. However, it is not always being treated as an unprecedented threat to the industry, the BBC s. (). The company is reported to be involved in an attempt to avoid an outage of crypto currency, and could become the first person to take advantage of an investigation into the market manipulation and risks associated with its trading on its platform, as it appears to have gone on trial for the second time in more than two decades - and it has failed to stop traders from accessing the platform without permission to use its cryptocurrency accounts, writes the New York Times, but analysts are warning that the company will not face stricter oversight of its regulators and shareholders, who claimed he was among the most successful investors in recent years, after the firm was fined $150,000 (750,000) by the Federal Trade Commission (FTX) which says it had been given significant damage to its assets, despite claims that it was hit by another massive amount of time to protect its customers. The US regulator has warned it will be in danger of falling into serious troubles in its handling of Bitcoin markets. But why is it likely to get behind the risk of unregistered trading?</p>

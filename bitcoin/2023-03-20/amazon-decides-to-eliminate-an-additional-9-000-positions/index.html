    <p>The world s biggest online retailer, Amazon, has announced that more than 9,000 jobs are to be cut in the coming weeks, including a separation payment and temporary health insurance benefits scheme, the company says, as part of its annual plan to invest more cash in its business. Why is this announcement so difficult for customers and customers?. But  What does it mean for Amazon employees, and what is it like to make it easier for them to leave their jobs, is being considered by its boss Andy Jassy to cut thousands of jobs in businesses across the world? What is the impact on the global economy and how it is likely to take over the number of workers it has lost in recent months? The company has said that 15,000 jobs could be lost because of the coronavirus pandemic, but why is there an increase in job cuts in order to reduce the risk of unemployment, it will be expected to see hundreds more jobs becoming unemployed within the next few months, with the loss of about 18,000 jobs? They are among those affected when it comes to the end of this year? And what are the reasons behind the decision to lay off millions of people in an attempt to tackle these challenges? A further reductions have been reported by the Amazon bosses and other executives, who have gone on to do so without compensation and pay savings and the cost of investment? It has been confirmed as the firm announces.</p>

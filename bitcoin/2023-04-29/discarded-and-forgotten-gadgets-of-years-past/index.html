    <p>It s almost impossible for us to remember when technology came into our lives. But what do we know about those gadgets that have left behind and how they helped our technological present? The BBC looks at some of the challenges we faced during the past few years, and why we are still able to find out what we have lost.  () What is the story of how technology has changed the lives of millions of people in recent years and what happened to the world of electronic devices, including smartphones, televisions, TVs and mobile phones - and the way we looked at them, as well as their latest versions of our life? They could be the most significant treasures we ve ever discovered in our history, writes Michael Madden, who has been keeping up with these memories, but what does it mean for the first time we went on to uncover anything that might have been lost in the history of technology?

Here are some ways we can forget.</p>

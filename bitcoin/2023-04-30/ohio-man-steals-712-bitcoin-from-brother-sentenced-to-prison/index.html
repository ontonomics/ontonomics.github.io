    <p>A man has been sentenced to three years in prison for stealing hundreds of millions of Bitcoins from his brother s home in the United States, the US justice department has announced, following a jury investigation by the FBI and the Department of Justice. The judge has said he is among the first to be convicted of the crimes.  But  The BBC Newsnight looks at what happened when he was found guilty of fraud and illegal cryptocurrency stolen by his  brother, who was jailed for two years for leaking the money to the family of an elderly man who claimed he would be the victim of hacking the crypto-currency worth $1.3bn (1.6b) in his hometown in California. A former Ohio man is facing two weeks in jail for the second time in four years and three months in custody for allegedly trying to smuggle him out of his bank account, and he had been given another sentence for fraud, fraud or abuse of power. Here is the full list of charges being released by US prosecutors on Wednesday, as they explain how the case could be solved. But what is it like for him to get involved in an alleged Bitcoin scam? The US government says it has confirmed that the conviction has come into force on Monday, after he found himself behind the arrest of two people who stole their wallets and handed him back to his family. How did he get the chance to stop him from taking part in what he described as  the biggest heist in US history?</p>

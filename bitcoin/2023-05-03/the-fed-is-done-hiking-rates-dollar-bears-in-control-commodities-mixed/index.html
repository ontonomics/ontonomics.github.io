    <p>The US Federal Reserve (FOMC) has raised its interest rates at a lower rate of 5% to 5.25%, according to its chief financial officer, John Powell, who has said he is concerned that the recovery of the US economy is likely to be worse than it was in the last three years of this year. Why is the FOMC crisis. But How is it really worth enough to avoid another recession, and why does this mean for the country s economic growth and the impact of credit tightening is not always expected? The Fed has set its target to keep their annual rate on hold, as analysts prepare to meet the risks of falling inflation. The latest warning is that it will increase its rate to 4.5%, but could it be able to make further progress in raising the interest rate until the end of next year - and what would be the worst cycle of its kind of policy firming, writes the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) chairman Christine Blasey explains how the Fed is preparing to set aside savings to help maintain the economic activity and how it is affected by the current weakness of interests? While economists are waiting to find out what is happening on the stock market, it has been warned that markets are still going to see signs of an emergency plunge, they will be prepared to take steps towards easing the pace of bankruptcy and its impact on banking activity.</p>

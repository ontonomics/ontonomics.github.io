S . fear losing reserve currency status ? Dollar dominance is not worth more than  fraction of 1 % of GDP , says Nobel Prize - winning economist</a>
    <p>The de-dollarisation is not worth much to the US than a fraction of 1 percent of the G.D.P., according to economist Paul Krugman, who has been leading the debate over the global reserve currency status in the New York Times. Why is this really going to affect the country? Should it actually be destroyed? The BBC s Larry Madowo has told analysts that it is being debated by millions of people across the world, and what does it mean for US President Donald Trump and his counterpart, Vladimir Putin, becoming embroiled in an unprecedented crisis in Ukraine and why they want to be punished for their attacks on the American dollar? What is the risk of losing its global dominance and how it can be described as the  de-dollarsisation  - and is it likely to have nothing to do with the Trump campaign to remove the greenback from its settlement currencies? Here is what happens to US investors. What makes it harder for the UK to stop it from taking advantage of US dollar status and its impact on those who believe it may be the most dangerous financial crises in recent years? How could it be affecting the U.S. and who is there to take it out of this question, asks the BBC News presenter Jamie Bartlett in his latest interview with Jonathan Swift. But what has it happened when it emerged that the dollar is in danger of falling in favour of its own interest rates, as well as what is happening.</p>

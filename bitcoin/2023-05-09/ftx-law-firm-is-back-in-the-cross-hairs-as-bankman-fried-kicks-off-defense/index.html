    <p>The former chief executive of the US cryptocurrency exchange FTX has asked a federal court to designate him as part of an investigation into his alleged involvement in the bankruptcy dispute, US prosecutors have confirmed, citing calls for an impeachment inquiry against the firms lawyers and their financial affairs.. But  () The US government has said it is being investigated for the first time in more than two decades, according to reports from New York, the FBI has been accused of corruption and money laundering, fraud and campaign finance charges in which he appeared to be involved in his criminal row over the company, as it collapsed last year. Another one-time crypto billionaire, Sam Bankman-Fried has defended his claim that he is facing fraud, misconduct and fraud claims. The company has denied further attacks on him, but says he will be prosecuted by the Trump administration in an attempt to stop him from taking office. A court has ruled that his case could lead to the prosecution of his ex-CEO, John Ray, who is in charge of fraud in US law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and his legal team is to take part in its criminal case in Washington DC, after the court ordered him to launch an appeal to charge him with fraud or fraud at the end of this year s US courts, in order to prevent him losing his business during the pandemic, with an unprecedented legal battle with the government.</p>

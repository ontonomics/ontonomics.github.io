But What is it likely to be the last tour to go on pre-sale? The BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at tickets for his next tour for those who are expected to get back in next years US tour. Why is this one of the most successful tours to take place in US history and where they will be sold for more than 500,000?

And what does it mean for him to tour the United States in April? Here is the full list of some of its latest announcements, as the BBC explains how it goes to sell records. But what happened to him in this summer? What are the key reasons for this headline - and what will happen to Paul during the next few months.

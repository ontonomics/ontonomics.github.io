Lastly, it is important to be cautious of new scam tactics being used by criminals. They are now sending fake PayPal invoices for high-value items that the recipient hasn&rsquo;t purchased. These invoices appear legitimate and are difficult to distinguish from real ones. Scammers take advantage of the trust associated with PayPal and use generative AI to create convincing scam messages. The goal is to get recipients to click on the invoice and either pay or contact the seller. To protect against these scams, it is crucial to be cautious, verify the legitimacy of invoices independently, and keep personal information private.

  <meta name="description" content="Amazon Web Services (AWS) has selected 25 African fintech startups for its inaugural FinTech Africa Accelerator cohort. The startups, from countries including Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Ghana, Uganda, and Cameroon, were chosen from over 500 applications. They will participate in a 10-week program starting in June, receiving technical review workshops, up to $25,000 in AWS technical credits, mentorship, and sector advice. Africa&rsquo;s fintech ecosystem is rapidly growing, with the continent expected to reach $2 billion in fintech investment by 2022. The cohort includes startups focused on various areas, such as finance/lending, cryptocurrency, remittance, and payment management.
In the world of digital assets, there were several cybersecurity incidents reported. A hacker exploited Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer, to steal $1 million. Hackers used a phishing service called Inferno Drainer to steal $5.9 million from victims. A potential hardware vulnerability was found in the Trezor T hardware wallet. Celer, a cross-chain protocol, patched a bug that could have allowed hackers to steal funds. These incidents highlight the importance of strong cybersecurity measures when dealing with digital assets.

Stably aims to power the next billion Web3 users with a seamless fiat-to-crypto and stablecoin onramp.

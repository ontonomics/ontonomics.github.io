  <meta name="description" content="Insurance company Evertas has announced an increase in coverage limits for digital assets, including custodial crypto assets and mining operations. The per-policy coverage limits for custodial crypto assets will increase to $420 million, while coverage for mining operations will be up to $200 million per policy.
Evertas is one of the few insurers focused on cryptocurrency and digital assets and is the only one with official cover holder status by Lloyd&rsquo;s of London. The company aims to provide comprehensive coverage and ease the pain point of customers having to mix and match policies. Currently, less than 1% of cryptocurrency assets are insured.
This news highlights the growing importance of digital assets and the need for proper insurance coverage. As more individuals and businesses embrace cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, the value of digital assets continues to rise. However, this also brings about new risks and challenges that need to be addressed.
Cryptocurrency, often referred to as digital currency, is a form of virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. It operates on a decentralized network called the blockchain, which is a public ledger that records all transactions. This technology ensures transparency and security, making it difficult for hackers to manipulate the system.
One of the key features of cryptocurrencies is their peer-to-peer nature. This means that transactions can be conducted directly between individuals without the need for intermediaries such as banks. This not only reduces transaction costs but also increases financial inclusion, especially for those who are unbanked or underbanked.
Cryptography plays a crucial role in securing digital assets. It involves the use of complex mathematical algorithms to encrypt and decrypt information. This ensures that transactions and data remain confidential and secure. Without cryptography, cryptocurrencies would be vulnerable to hacking and fraud.
The decentralization of cryptocurrencies is another important aspect. Unlike traditional currencies that are controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies are not governed by any central authority. This gives individuals more control over their own money and reduces the risk of government interference or manipulation.
Digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, are becoming increasingly recognized as valuable assets. They can be used for various purposes, such as investments, online purchases, and even as a store of value. However, their intangible nature and the lack of physical presence make them vulnerable to theft and loss.
This is where insurance coverage for digital assets becomes crucial. By providing coverage for custodial crypto assets and mining operations, Evertas aims to protect individuals and businesses from potential losses due to theft, hacking, or other unforeseen events. This not only gives peace of mind to cryptocurrency holders but also promotes the adoption and acceptance of digital assets in the mainstream financial industry.
In conclusion, the increase in insurance coverage for digital assets is a positive development for the cryptocurrency industry. It addresses the need for proper protection and risk management in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. As more individuals and businesses embrace cryptocurrencies, it is important to have comprehensive insurance coverage to safeguard their valuable digital assets. Evertas&#39; initiative is a step in the right direction towards creating a more secure and resilient digital economy.

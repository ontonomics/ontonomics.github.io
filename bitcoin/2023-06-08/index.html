  <meta name="description" content="The cryptocurrency market experienced slight gains today as the impact of the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase began to fade. This news comes as a relief to investors who were concerned about the potential impact of these lawsuits on the market. Stocks also rose today due to an increase in unemployment claims, leading investors to believe that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates.
Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, has remained stable in its trading range, with support at $26,700. In order to avoid a bearish takeover, it is crucial for the support level of $26,100 to be maintained. Altcoins, on the other hand, had a mixed day, with some seeing gains and others seeing losses.
The overall cryptocurrency market cap is currently $1.05 trillion, with Bitcoin&rsquo;s dominance rate at 38%. This indicates that Bitcoin continues to be the dominant player in the market, despite the growing popularity of other cryptocurrencies.
In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the country&rsquo;s top financial regulator, has released new guidelines for the advertising of cryptocurrency services. These guidelines aim to ensure that people have the appropriate knowledge and experience to invest in crypto and that advertisements are clear, fair, and not misleading. The guidelines include stricter rules for advertisers and cryptocurrency exchanges, such as clear risk warnings, banning incentives to invest, and client categorization requirements.
Additionally, all companies offering crypto services in the UK must implement a &ldquo;cooling-off period&rdquo; for first-time investors, and the use of &ldquo;refer a friend&rdquo; bonuses is prohibited. These new rules will go into effect on October 8, and they are expected to bring more transparency and accountability to the cryptocurrency industry in the UK.
In the face of the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuit against Coinbase, the CEO of the company, Brian Armstrong, has spoken out in defense of his company. Armstrong stated that Coinbase had been in discussions with the SEC for a long time and had been forthcoming with information about their business operations. However, they received no feedback or guidance from the SEC during their meetings. Armstrong criticized the SEC&rsquo;s regulation-by-enforcement approach and expressed his desire for a clear rulebook to allow the industry to operate in a safe and trusted way.
Despite the regulatory challenges, Armstrong stated that Coinbase would not consider leaving the U.S. and would instead seek clarity through legal means or congressional action. He also noted that the crypto market remained bullish and resilient in the face of the SEC&rsquo;s actions.
In other news, CoinDesk, a leading source of news and information on cryptocurrency and digital assets, has updated its privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information. CoinDesk follows strict editorial policies and is an independent subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups. Some CoinDesk employees, including editorial staff, may receive exposure to DCG equity as part of their compensation. However, CoinDesk journalists are not permitted to directly purchase stock in DCG.
Overall, today&rsquo;s news highlights the ongoing regulatory challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry. However, it also demonstrates the resilience of the market and the determination of industry leaders to seek clarity and operate in a safe and trusted manner. As the market continues to evolve, it is important for investors to stay informed and make educated decisions about their investments in cryptocurrencies.

    <p>It s a warning that crypto-currency companies are threatening the future of the global financial system, and that they could be able to tackle the crisis within their own states. But what is it like to be the most dangerous battle in the world of crypto currencies and why does it really happen to the industry and how is the fight?. What is this coming when it comes to cryptocurrencies, which is being investigated by the US regulators, has been called Gary Gensler, who has told the BBC that he would become the first person to warn cryptocurrency companies about the dangers of cyber-crime and the risk of stealing money from the digital currency - and what makes it harder for him to avoid it? Why is he likely to have to do it to stop the cybercrimes that have gone on the rise of hackers and cybercriminals? It is an increasingly growing battle between the two largest exchanges in Europe and around the country? The BBC has learned about how he is facing the battle to protect the Crypto-currencies against those who have been accused of failing to register the assets of Bitcoin and Binance, as well as his former chief executive of US intelligence officers in Washington DC, is that it is hard to find out what happened in his own way to control the crypto market, but what will happen if he gets into custody, how might it be liked to take advantage of such attacks? What goes on to prevent them from breaking rules?</p>

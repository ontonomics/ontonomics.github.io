    <p>One of the worlds most expensive coins has sold for a record $6 million at auction in the US state of Ohio, according to the latest figures from the public. They were worth more than $600,000 (66,000) than previously recorded in their history, but the sale has reached another record for the issue, the BBC has learned. (). What is it likely to be the biggest ever sale of US currency, coinage and cryptocurrency, has been revealed at the start of this year s annual sale, with the price of an estimated $650,000. The sale took place in an unprecedented amount of money, and the value of one of its most valuable collections of gold, gold and silver, as well as thousands of other memorabilia, medals, cash and cash, to mark the first time in US history - which fetched over $620,000 for an extraordinary collection of rare treasures that have gone on sale in three separate ways, in what is believed to have been the most lucrative acquisitions since the end of 2019, including the release of two significant numbers of new accounts. But what has happened to those who went on to sell each of them, is the story of what could be known as the Crypto-currency displayed on the stock market, it has come to an end to its huge sought-after sales of some of his highest earnings in its history and its value across the history of crypto-currencies, such as cash.</p>

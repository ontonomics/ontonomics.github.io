These recent events show the challenges and opportunities in the world of cryptocurrencies. DeFi is a way for people to do financial things without banks. It uses blockchain technology to make transactions safe and clear.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are digital money that use codes to be safe and control how many there are. They are also called virtual or digital money. One good thing about cryptocurrencies is that they don&rsquo;t need traditional banks, so they can&rsquo;t be controlled by the government.
But, as the attacks on the Poly Network show, cryptocurrencies can be risky. It&rsquo;s important for people and groups to be careful and protect their money.
Overall, cryptocurrencies are changing and have good and bad things. It&rsquo;s important to learn about them and stay updated. This way, we can use this technology and make a better future for ourselves and future generations.

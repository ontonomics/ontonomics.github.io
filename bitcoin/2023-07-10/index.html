  <meta name="description" content="The United Kingdom is taking a groundbreaking step in protecting its citizens from scams. Starting next year, banks will be required to compensate victims of scams, unless they acted fraudulently or with gross negligence. This move aims to drive down losses by incentivizing banks to invest in detection and prevention. Australia is also considering implementing similar laws, as scams in the country reached a record high of over $3 billion last year. However, Australian banks have voiced their opposition to such requirements. Under the new UK scheme, customers will be reimbursed within five days, except in cases of fraud or gross negligence.
In another effort to protect consumers, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is cracking down on unregistered crypto ATMs in the UK. These machines allow people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with cards or cash, but they are not connected to a bank account. The FCA warns that using these machines is illegal and poses a risk of financial loss, as there is no protection or means of contacting the machine operator. The FCA urges the public to be cautious and will take enforcement action against unregistered operators. It is important to note that cryptoassets are unregulated and high-risk.
On a more positive note, the social dominance of XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, has seen a significant increase in July. This rise in social chatter could potentially lead to increased demand for XRP, which has been under selling pressure. Despite this, XRP prices have remained relatively stable and have not been able to break above the $0.50 level. However, the increase in social dominance suggests that market sentiment could change, and there may be a potential rally in prices. This is especially significant considering the recent fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the crypto market due to regulatory actions against popular exchanges.
In other news, India is making strides in the semiconductor industry. With the increasing demand for semiconductors driven by factors such as 5G technology, cryptocurrency mining, and digitalization efforts, India has the potential to become a talent powerhouse in this field. The government has announced a $10 billion investment in the India Semiconductor Mission to support research and development. Despite challenges such as high costs, the government has implemented initiatives like the Make in India program and incentives for semiconductor manufacturing. With its highly skilled workforce, India is attracting foreign companies like Micron Technology and Applied Materials, who are investing in the country.

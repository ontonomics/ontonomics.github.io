    <p>US prosecutors are seeking changes to the bail agreement between the former chief financial officer of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, the New York Times has told a court in the US state of California that he is being detained for more than two weeks, while he remains under house arrest. The judge has said he will not be released. But  The US government has warned the BBC s Christine Blasey spoke to his lawyer, Mark Cohen, who says he wants to put him in jail ahead of his trial in October, as he prepares to leave the case. Before the trial is due to start next month, US officials have asked the government to change his bail order to stop him from detaining him at the end of this year, but he has been given permission to be charged with fraud charges in his case against him, and called for him to go on trial on Wednesday, after he was arrested in California for the first time in nearly two decades in custody, in an attempt to get him out of prison earlier than expected, to ask him for further notices about his alleged involvement in charge of fraud, fraud and fraud claims which could threaten his release from the court.</p>

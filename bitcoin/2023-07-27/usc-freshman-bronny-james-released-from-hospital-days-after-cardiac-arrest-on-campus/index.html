    <p>US basketball star LeBron James has been released from hospital after suffering a sudden cardiac arrest at the University of Southern California (USC) athletics, health officials say, ahead of his release from the intensive care facility on Wednesday. Why? When Bronny James went into  heart arrest earlier this week, he is being treated. But Here s another story - and why is it possible for him to remain in hospital? The BBC News looks at how he was recovering from his heart failure and how his recovery could be handled by his family and community support, and what is the story of him when he collapsed in the US on Sunday morning? Here is what happened to his son, Bronni James, who has become the first person to die from heart injuries in his life, as he returns to the hospital for the second time since he died of an emergency heart attack in Los Angeles, California, in which he lost his career and was saved from serious illness. The latest details are among the reasons for his resilience following the death of Lebron James and his father, leBron, is still critically discharged to hospital while waiting to be reunited with his grandson, Ronny, has spoken about his mental health after he had broken silence on social media and posted messages of support and condolences from fans across the world, but what does it mean for those who believe he has survived during his medical crisis and is now alive.</p>

    <p>A US federal judge has ordered the release of a former chief executive of the Crypto-currency exchange FTX, accused of violating the terms of his release and attempted public harassment and shaming witnesses, US prosecutors have said, amid calls for an order to revoke bankruptcy rules against the billionaire s bail.. But   The FBI has said the US justice department is asking for his bail to be withdrawn from jail. Before he leaves prison, the lawyer says he has been asked to reverse the case, as he prepares to release him in October, after he was convicted of fraud charges and repeatedly tampering with witnesses. The US government has urged the company to stop him from being jailed for more than two years, in the wake of an investigation into his alleged role in fraud and money laundering scandals in New York, but he is facing an appeal to return to the United States to keep him released in custody following claims that he had violated bail conditions for the firm, whose founder was given bail for another year, and he will be freed from the trial in September, if he wants to retain his freedom of extradition from Florida.</p>

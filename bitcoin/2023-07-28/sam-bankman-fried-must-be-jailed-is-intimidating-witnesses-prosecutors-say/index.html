    <p>US prosecutors have asked the government to detain a man accused of stealing $250m (152m) of his cryptocurrency exchange, the New York Times has announced, amid reports he is trying to influence witnesses and influence their testimony, writes the lawyers of the US state s Attorney General Louis Kaplan, who has said. But  The US government has warned that he could be jailed for another year because of an attempted public harassment, shaming and intimidation. Before his trial, it has been told he will be detained in his home in California, in which he was convicted of fraud charges, and threatening to expose himself to the press, US authorities have said they are asking for him to be released from prison until October, after his bail was rejected by the Trump administration to stop him from detaining him during his extradition from the United States, as he prepares to begin talks with journalists about his alleged involvement in an investigation into the FTX financial crisis, but he has denied being involved in fraud trials in the wake of what he said was the first case to come out of custody - including the case of one of its former chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, will not be prosecuted pending his appeal for his release in September, before he faces jail sentence for the second time in three years. The FBI has urged the court to keep him under house arrest for two weeks.</p>

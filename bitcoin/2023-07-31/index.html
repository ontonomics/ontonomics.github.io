  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we have some interesting updates on the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Let&rsquo;s dive right in.
First up, we have Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. The company&rsquo;s CEO, Brian Armstrong, revealed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked Coinbase to halt trading on all cryptocurrencies except for Bitcoin. The SEC claimed that these cryptocurrencies qualify as securities and that Coinbase was operating as an unregistered national securities exchange. This request from the SEC could have set a dangerous precedent and potentially ended the crypto industry in the U.S. The regulatory status of digital assets remains unclear, with both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission vying for oversight.
Moving on, we have an investigation into Worldcoin, the iris-scanning cryptocurrency venture by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Germany&rsquo;s Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision has been looking into the project over concerns about accessing sensitive data. This investigation adds to the growing number of European inquiries into Worldcoin, indicating a potentially challenging regulatory road ahead for the project. Critics of Worldcoin have raised concerns about data privacy and security, as well as the lack of prior identification or verification for participants.
In other news, international startup accelerator ZEBOX is set to open its U.S. headquarters in Crystal City. The accelerator will provide physical space and mentorship to promising startups that aim to solve supply-chain issues. ZEBOX will also connect these startups with large shipping and transportation companies. The Crystal City location will focus on cybersecurity, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. ZEBOX has exciting plans, including a summer boot camp for university students and aspiring entrepreneurs, as well as quarterly events and a podcast.
Now, let&rsquo;s talk about the current state of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has been trading within a tight range, with bulls and bears struggling to gain momentum. To see a bullish breakout, Bitcoin needs to print candles above the 100-week moving average. However, it has yet to test this level and has faced resistance at $29,500. If Bitcoin cannot clear the $28,300 level, a run at the lows is expected. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin&rsquo;s store of value narrative remains strong, with institutional interest potentially bringing a new wave of optimism and increased demand.
In the world of legal matters, Heart and PulseChain are facing fraud charges for allegedly using investors&#39; money for personal gain. The SEC claims that Heart misrepresented the investments and attempted to avoid securities regulations. Authorities in Miri, Borneo, have also shut down an illegal cryptocurrency mining operation after receiving information from local citizens. The operation had 34 mining servers powered by stolen electricity, highlighting the ongoing issue of electricity theft in the region.
Lastly, the IRS has clarified that if a taxpayer stakes cryptocurrency and receives additional units as rewards, the fair market value of the rewards should be included in their gross income. This ruling applies whether the staking is done directly or through a crypto exchange. It&rsquo;s important for taxpayers to stay informed about the tax implications of their cryptocurrency activities.
That&rsquo;s all for today&rsquo;s news digest. We hope this update has provided you with valuable insights into the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Stay informed and keep an eye on these developments as they continue to shape the future of digital assets.

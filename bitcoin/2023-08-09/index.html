  <meta name="description" content="Bitdeer, a crypto mining firm spun off from Bitmain, has entered into an agreement with B. Riley Financial to sell up to $150 million of its Class A ordinary shares. The agreement allows Bitdeer to sell a specified number of shares to B. Riley over three years, with a maximum purchase of 1 million shares or 25% of Bitdeer&rsquo;s shares traded on the Nasdaq. B. Riley&rsquo;s ownership in Bitdeer will not exceed 4.99%. As part of the transaction, Bitdeer will pay B. Riley 0.5% of the deal&rsquo;s value and reimburse legal fees. Bitdeer provides cloud-mining services and recently partnered with Druk Holding and Investments to create an eco-friendly mining operation in Bhutan.
Worldcoin, a controversial cryptocurrency project, aims to collect biometric data through scanning people&rsquo;s eyeballs to create a proof-of-personhood system. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency in data collection methods, posing a potential privacy threat. Investigative reporters have also exposed unethical practices in data collection, particularly in the Global South. The project&rsquo;s native token, WLD, currently lacks a real use case and is primarily speculative.
Nvidia is repackaging its RTX GPUs for AI enthusiasts, aiming to make GPUs more accessible for AI applications. The new GPUs, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture, can be used for AI inferencing and training. At the SIGGRAPH conference, Nvidia announced new desktop and workstation designs with RTX GPUs, with computer makers like Dell and Lenovo offering workstations that can accommodate up to four RTX 6000 GPUs. Nvidia also introduced the L40S Ada GPU, a faster version of the H100, and announced AI Enterprise 4.0 with the Nemo large-language model. The low-end RTX 4000 and RTX 4500 GPUs will also be available soon.
Coinbase&rsquo;s Base network has officially launched, allowing users to bridge tokens, swap tokens, provide liquidity, make payments, register usernames, launch decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and mint and collect nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Several Web3 development teams have released apps for Base, including Uniswap and Maverick Protocol. However, the launch has not been without issues, as some investors lost money due to launch problems with memecoins. Despite this, Base is expected to attract more users into Web3 protocols with its large user base.
The article discusses the creation of the private Federal Reserve and the concept of fractional reserve banking, where banks can create money out of thin air. It highlights the unfairness of this system, as it steals the purchasing power from the general public and concentrates wealth in the hands of a few banks and financial institutions. The article also suggests ways to protect oneself from the potential collapse of the banking system, such as using physical cash, boycotting money center banks, and moving to libertarian communities.
Ripple (XRP) is expected to experience a bearish trend for the rest of Q3 2023 following a price surge in July. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) investors are losing hope after rumors of its inclusion on the X platform turned out to be false. Investors are now turning to Borroe ($ROE) for reliable returns, as the platform has already sold 9 million tokens and raised $250,000 in its first presale stage. Borroe ($ROE) aims to provide a decentralized fundraising marketplace for web3 participants. On the other hand, Ripple (XRP) is facing regulatory challenges from the US SEC, which is keeping its price bearish.
SpiritSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Fantom platform, will shut down on September 1 due to a hack on the Chinese cross-chain protocol Multichain. The hack emptied SpiritSwap&rsquo;s bank account, leaving them unable to finance their operations. The team is looking for a new team to take over the DEX by September 1, or else it will cease operations. SpiritSwap was once a prominent DEX on Fantom, with a high total value locked (TVL), but it has since fallen due to the Multichain incident. Multichain&rsquo;s CEO was arrested in May, and there are suspicions of a strategy to steal user funds. Fantom&rsquo;s TVL has also decreased as a result.
Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee have expressed concerns about PayPal&rsquo;s launch of a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, citing the lack of a regulatory framework to ensure investor protection. Committee ranking member Maxine Waters called for clear and strong consumer protections at the federal level, stating that stablecoins represent the issuance of a new form of money. In contrast, Republican leadership sees the stablecoin as a potential example of regulatory clarity. The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, which aims to establish regulations for stablecoins, has passed the committee and awaits a full vote in the House.
CipherTrace, a Mastercard company, has submitted a report supporting the defense in the United States v. Roman Sterlingov case. The report challenges the efficacy of data obtained by blockchain investigation organization Chainalysis, stating that it cannot be corroborated on-chain. Sterlingov is accused of being the founder of Bitcoin Fog, a cryptocurrency mixing service involved in illegal money laundering. His defense attorneys argue that Chainalysis failed to trace transactions back to their client and that the government&rsquo;s case is built on Chainalysis&#39; data. The report recommends an independent audit of Chainalysis&#39; blockchain analysis methodologies to prevent wrongful arrests.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to appeal a court decision that ruled in favor of Ripple Labs, stating that the sale of Ripple&rsquo;s XRP token complied with federal securities laws. The SEC believes that an appeal could address legal issues and have significant consequences for its ability to enforce securities laws. The SEC has long claimed that cryptocurrencies are securities and has sued Ripple for illegally raising funds through the sale of XRP. The court&rsquo;s decision was not a complete victory for Ripple, as it found that the company violated securities laws by selling XRP to institutional investors.

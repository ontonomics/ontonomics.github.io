    <p>The founder of a huge cryptocurrency hedge fund has been taken into custody in the US after being convicted of attempting to interfere with key witnesses, his lawyers have told the New York Times, amid growing calls for him to appeal for his upcoming criminal trial in October - which means he will be released. But  One US court has ruled that the former chief executive of FTX is to be charged with stealing hundreds of billions worth of money from customers in order to evade financial damages, as he appears to face further criminal charges over alleged fraud investigations on the bankruptcy crisis, but will now be forced to stand trial for another year in jail for the first time in more than two decades, after his bail was revoked by prosecutors. Another judge has rejected his decision to stop him from prison, say their jurys and relatives in his bid to challenge his conviction for fraud, writes the BBC s Michael Madden, who says he is among the most wanted traders who have been arrested on bail, and is now expected to return to the trial next month, in an effort to frustrate the case.</p>

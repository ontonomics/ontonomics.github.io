  <meta name="description" content="The price of oranges and the price of bitcoins have a strong correlation every year. Since 2020, both orange prices and bitcoin prices have been on the rise. The correlation between the two validates the theory that bitcoin can serve as an inflation shelter. Global orange prices have increased by over 180% since January 2020, while BTC has climbed about 230% during the same period. This correlation is due to the impact of inflation on the value of the dollar and consumer goods. Bitcoin is seen as a digital currency that can protect earnings from inflation.
In other news, Dinari, a cryptocurrency startup, is making waves in the world of tokenized equities. The company has received funding from Susquehanna International Group and other investors, and it aims to comply with securities laws. Dinari has acquired a broker-dealer in the US and registered with the SEC as a transfer agent. Its flagship product, dShares, allows investors outside the US to use cryptocurrencies to buy shares of major US companies and ETFs. What sets Dinari apart from previous projects is that its tokenized stocks are backed one-to-one by real-world shares. This provides investors with a level of security and transparency that was previously lacking in the cryptocurrency space. The platform operates under Regulation S, allowing SEC-compliant sales of securities to overseas investors.
Moving on, the CEO of Bitkub Capital Group Holdings, Topp Jirayut Srupsrisopa, shares his insights on cryptocurrencies and the future of digital assets. He acknowledges that cryptocurrencies are the riskiest asset ever invented but also recognizes their value. Jirayut emphasizes the importance of proper banking practices and regulation to establish confidence in digital assets. He also discusses the potential benefits and concerns of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). While he believes that CBDCs can reduce corruption and increase transparency, he also acknowledges the potential for authoritarian governments to monitor and control citizens&#39; wealth. Jirayut advises individual investors to use strong security measures and only invest money they can afford to lose.
In conclusion, the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues to evolve and make headlines. The correlation between the price of oranges and bitcoins highlights the potential of bitcoin as an inflation shelter. Meanwhile, Dinari is revolutionizing the tokenization of equities by providing a secure and transparent platform for investors. And the CEO of Bitkub Capital Group Holdings reminds us of the risks and benefits associated with digital assets, urging investors to exercise caution and adopt strong security measures. As the world of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, it is important for individuals to stay informed and make educated decisions about their investments.

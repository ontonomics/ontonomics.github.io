  <meta name="description" content="The world of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, and today we bring you the latest news on Bitcoin and other digital assets. Let&rsquo;s dive in and see what&rsquo;s been happening in the crypto space.
First up, we have some unfortunate news from the NFT platform Recur. Due to unforeseen challenges and shifts in the business landscape, Recur has announced that it will be shutting down. Users will no longer be able to buy or sell NFTs on the platform, but they can still access their media and metadata through IPFS. This follows a trend in the NFT community, with fellow creator Nifty also closing its doors. However, there is still hope for NFTs, as CBS Studios was granted a trademark for Star Trek Continuum NFTs.
In other news, Revain (REV) has seen a 4.5% increase in trading against the dollar in the past 24 hours. Revain is a utility token based on Ethereum and Tron, aiming to provide transparent and authentic user feedback on global products and services using blockchain and machine learning.
Metal (MTL) has experienced a 0.6% decrease in value against the dollar in the past 24 hours. Metal is a cryptocurrency that powers the Metal Pay digital wallet and payment processing platform, offering fast, feeless, and secure peer-to-peer transactions.
Now, let&rsquo;s talk about CAIZcoin, a cryptocurrency focused on inclusion and moral finance. CAIZcoin has made its debut on international exchanges, aiming to make digital assets accessible to a wide range of consumers. The company prioritizes transparency, security, and forward-thinking, and has been developed by a team of experts from the blockchain and financial industries.
Moving on, a GitHub repository set up by Yearn Finance&rsquo;s developer revealed crypto wallet addresses linked to Friend.tech users. Friend.tech is a social platform within the Base network that allows users to buy and sell &ldquo;shares&rdquo; of their connections. Despite concerns about the exposure of blockchain transactions, some experts argue that the public disclosure of wallet addresses is not a major issue.
Aragon (ANT), an open-source blockchain platform for decentralized organizations (DAOs), has traded slightly lower against the dollar in the last 24 hours. Aragon&rsquo;s native governance token is used for decision-making, voting, and trading on exchanges.
In the broader crypto market, Bitcoin&rsquo;s price dropped more than 12% last week, causing the total crypto market capitalization to fall by $81 billion. However, stocks saw some momentum in the afternoon, with gains in the tech sector helping boost the major indices. Bitcoin is currently trading sideways around the $26,000 support level, and analysts are cautious about further downside potential for BTC.
In the world of stablecoins, Coinbase Global is acquiring an equity stake in Circle Internet Financial and shutting down their jointly managed Centre Consortium, which operates the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC). Coinbase stated that with increased regulatory clarity for stablecoins, a separate governance body like Centre is no longer necessary. Circle will now have full control over USDC issuance and governance.
Lastly, Holo (HOT) has experienced a 2% decrease in value against the dollar in the past 24 hours. Holo is an ERC20 utility token used for transactions within the Holochain network, a platform for creating and running decentralized applications.
That&rsquo;s all for today&rsquo;s news digest. Stay tuned for more updates on the exciting world of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Remember, the crypto market is constantly evolving, so it&rsquo;s important to stay informed and make educated decisions.

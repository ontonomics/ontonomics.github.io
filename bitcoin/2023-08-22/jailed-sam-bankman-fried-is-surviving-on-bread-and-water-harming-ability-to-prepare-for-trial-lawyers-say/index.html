    <p>A former FTX founder has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy charges, his lawyers have said, despite a lack of access to computers and medications to help him prepare for his trial, the court has heard. Why is the bankman-fried struggling to cope with the challenges he faces?. But  The FBI (FTX) chief executive says he is not ready to appear at the trial of him in October 3 because of his  flush diet  while in jail, he has been jailed for more than two years and is facing severe threats for him to be prosecuted by prosecutors in New York, where he s being told he does not get enough to serve him vegan dishes, and how he can be prepared to face trial in the US, but why is he failing to get the right to take part in his legal battle? Should he be able to survive when he comes out of prison without adequate access, is having to do more to prevent him from going to trial - and has claimed he will not be convicted of some of the most dangerous cases he hears before he was ordered to go on trial for the first time in nearly two decades, as he struggles to make his appeals over his alleged fraud case against him, who has said he wants his bail revoked by the federal judges on Tuesday, saying he may not have reached an agreement.</p>

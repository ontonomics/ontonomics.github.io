    <p>Former FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried has been freed from jail after a court ruled he failed to adequately review the evidence against him, his lawyers have told the US Circuit Court of Appeals, which says he is being jailed for six weeks because of his long-running financial failures. Why is the BBC s Kunis reports. The former FBI chief executive has lost the right to stay free on bail, and why he has not been allowed to be released from behind bars while taking part in an investigation into his alleged involvement in the bank collapse has claimed he had to survive in prison for the first time in more than two decades, the court has heard. The US prosecutors are refusing to give him temporary bail until the end of October - and he will not be in custody for another decade, writes the New York Times. A judge has said he cannot afford his release to the trial, as he appealed for him to free him for his trial in November, after he lost his bail deal with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) when he was found guilty of fraud, fraud and conspiracy to influence witnesses during the fall of the companys multibillion-dollar corruption scandal, but he wants to keep him free, say their legal advisers, who appeared in court on his first day of legal action in US courts in his bid to protect himself and other investors and business leaders without permission.</p>

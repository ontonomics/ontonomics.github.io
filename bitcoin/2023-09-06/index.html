  <meta name="title" content="ARK Invest and 21Shares Seek SEC Approval for Ethereum ETF, State of Texas Pays Bitcoin Miner to Temporarily Shut Down Operations, and Fluctuations in Cryptocurrency Trading Prices"/>
  <meta name="description" content="Ark Invest and 21Shares have submitted a proposal to the SEC for an Ethereum-based ETF called ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF. This ETF aims to provide investors with direct access to Ethereum, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market. If approved, it will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange, giving investors an opportunity to invest in Ethereum without having to directly purchase and store the digital asset themselves.
The filing clarifies the roles of the involved parties, with 21Shares acting as the sponsor and Coinbase Custody Trust Company serving as the custodian. This ensures that the ETF will be managed and stored securely. However, the SEC&rsquo;s approval is still pending, and it remains to be seen whether this ETF will be given the green light.
This development will be discussed at the Benzinga&rsquo;s Future of Digital Assets conference, shedding light on the evolving landscape of digital assets. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain traction and mainstream acceptance, it is important for investors to stay informed about the latest developments in the industry.
In other news, the State of Texas has made an interesting move in the world of Bitcoin mining. The state paid Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms a whopping $31.7 million in energy credits to temporarily shut down its operations in August. This decision was made due to a heatwave, which put a strain on the state&rsquo;s energy grid.
Despite the large payment, Riot Platforms only made $8.9 million in mined Bitcoin during that month. However, the energy credits received will help the company become one of the lowest cost producers of Bitcoin in the industry. This agreement benefits Texas by stabilizing energy prices and ensuring that excess power is utilized effectively. It is a modern solution to address fluctuating energy prices and sporadic service.
Moving on to other cryptocurrencies, Radio Caca (RACA) and MetaMUI (MMUI) have seen fluctuations in their trading prices. RACA saw a 1.3% increase in trading against the dollar in the past 24 hours, while MetaMUI experienced a slight decrease in trading against the US dollar. These fluctuations highlight the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, where prices can change rapidly.
Similarly, Theta Network (THETA) and LEMONCHAIN (LEMC) have also experienced slight changes in their trading prices. Theta Network saw a slight increase in trading against the US dollar, while LEMONCHAIN experienced a slight decrease in value against the US dollar. These fluctuations remind us that investing in cryptocurrencies can be risky, and it is important to do thorough research and exercise caution when entering this market.
Lastly, Vai (VAI) has seen a slight increase in trading against the US dollar. VAI is Venus Protocol&rsquo;s native decentralized stablecoin, which is minted and redeemed on the Venus platform. This highlights the growing popularity of stablecoins, which are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by pegging them to a reserve asset, such as a fiat currency.
Overall, these news updates provide a glimpse into the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies. As the market continues to evolve, it is important for investors to stay informed and make educated decisions when it comes to investing in digital assets.

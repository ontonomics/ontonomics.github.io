  <meta name="title" content="Cryptocurrency News: Fluctuations in Wrapped HBAR, Numeraire, WEMIX, Trust Wallet Token, Strike, Hedera, Ripple, Hive, ZClassic, Hooked Protocol, XRP, Curve DAO Token, Velas, and GlobaleCrypto"/>
  <meta name="description" content="In the world of cryptocurrency, there is always something happening. Today, we bring you the latest news and updates on Bitcoin and other related digital assets. Let&rsquo;s dive in!
Wrapped HBAR (WHBAR) and Numeraire (NMR) are two cryptocurrencies that have seen some fluctuations in their trading prices. Wrapped HBAR operates on the Hedera Hashgraph platform and can be acquired by first buying Ethereum or Bitcoin. Numeraire, on the other hand, is a San Francisco-based hedge fund that uses machine learning to make trades in financial markets. It incentivizes data scientists to submit high-quality algorithms through its native currency, NMR.
WEMIX (WEMIX) and Trust Wallet Token (TWT) are also experiencing some changes in their trading values. WEMIX was launched in 2020 and has a total supply of 973,021,357 coins. It is currently trading on 47 active markets. Trust Wallet Token, created by the team behind Trust Wallet, offers governance, staking, and access to additional features within the ecosystem.
Strike (STRK) and Hedera (HBAR) have also seen slight fluctuations in their trading values. Strike is an autonomous and decentralized money market that allows for variable-based rates for collateral and borrowing. Hedera, on the other hand, can be bought by first purchasing Ethereum or Bitcoin using an exchange that deals in US dollars.
Ripple, a cryptocurrency company, has made an acquisition that will allow it to expand beyond its core focus on blockchain-enabled payments. The company has acquired startup Fortress Trust, which specializes in crypto infrastructure. This move will give Ripple a license in Nevada and open up new opportunities for growth.
Hive (HIVE) and ZClassic (ZCL) are two other cryptocurrencies that have seen changes in their trading values. Hive is an open-source blockchain platform that offers true ownership and control over cryptocurrency. ZClassic, on the other hand, aims to provide fair mining by removing the founder&rsquo;s reward.
Hooked Protocol (HOOK) is another cryptocurrency that has experienced fluctuations in its trading value. It operates on the BNB Smart Chain platform and has a total supply of 500,000,000 tokens.
In other news, XRP has seen a decline in public interest since its peak in July. However, some experts believe that now could be a good time to buy, as Ripple has introduced new features in its latest XRPL update. Technical indicators suggest that XRP&rsquo;s price could bounce back and potentially reach $1 in the long term.
Curve DAO Token (CRV) and Velas (VLX) are two more cryptocurrencies that have seen changes in their trading values. Curve DAO Token is a governance token used in the Curve Finance protocol, while Velas is a self-learning and self-optimizing blockchain platform that uses artificial intelligence to enhance its consensus algorithm.
Lastly, we have GlobaleCrypto, a leading cloud mining platform that empowers professionals to earn passive income from the comfort of their homes. With a user-friendly interface and a wide range of investment options, users can earn daily returns of up to $998. The platform prioritizes user security through advanced encryption protocols and multi-factor authentication.
That&rsquo;s all for today&rsquo;s news digest on Bitcoin and related digital assets. Stay tuned for more updates on the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency!

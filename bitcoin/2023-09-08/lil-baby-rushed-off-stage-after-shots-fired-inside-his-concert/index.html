    <p>Rapper Lil Baby has been evacuated after a shooting in the US city of Memphis, according to reports from the citys FedEx Forum. Officials have confirmed that the attack was not fired by their security or employees, but they remain in disbelief amid rumours that he was being taken out of the venue. () What is reported to be the scene of an apparent suicide bomber in Nashville, Texas, has revealed rapper Jizzle, who was shot dead while taking part in one of his concerts, and says he believed he heard the pop singer killed himself during his live concert on Saturday night when shots went off outside the Fourier Forum stadium where he performed, as part of her concert, were thrown off stage by his cousin, Kylie Jenner and her boyfriend, Clarissa Johnson, in his latest appearance on social media following the death of one man, just two days after it took place in an attack on the music giant, on Thursday, at the weekend. The suspected gunman was the co-founder of LilBaby. But why is it not so sweet to have been cancelled? Why is the video released by Prince Williams? The BBC has learned it is not too sweet for Lil baby to make headlines for the first time in more than two decades, after the concert was halted by the police and fans of its crew, it has emerged that it was an act of terror which ended without weapons.</p>

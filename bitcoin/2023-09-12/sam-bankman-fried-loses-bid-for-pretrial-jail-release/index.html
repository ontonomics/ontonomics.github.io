    <p>Former US billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried has lost a bid to be released from jail because of his conditions of confinement, US prosecutors have ruled, citing evidence he shared with former partner Caroline Ellison, according to reports from the New York Times and the Financial Times. Why is it possible for him to testify against him?. But Here is the BBC s Christine Blasey looks at how he is being detained in the US state of Nevada, in which he has been jailed for more than two years, and why is he unable to access his lawyers to find out if he can be freed from prison. The US Supreme Court has rejected his appeal for his release, saying he had not asked for another trial on fraud charges, but could remain in custody for the first time in nearly two decades, the court has heard - and it is possible that he will not be prosecuted by judges on his trial. A court filing has shown that the bankman failed to properly review those claims he was allowed to release him from detention centres in Brooklyn, Brooklyn and Washington DC, as he prepares for trial in his case, writes The Wall Street Journal, on the day before the trial is due to take place in September, after finding that his conviction was  inadequate  and has not been given permission to launch his legal challenge to the case ahead of next month t delay, it has emerged. Here, we speak to him.</p>

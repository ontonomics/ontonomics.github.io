    <p>The chief legal officer of Coinbase has said he is optimistic about a lawsuit filed against the US Central Security Agency (SEC) over the crypto-related cases of Grayscale and Ripple, which appeared to be linked to the agencys attitude towards the industry. However, he has told the BBC that the case could make another. (). The US regulator has warned that it is being asked to take action to prevent the company from operating as an unregistered securities exchange and clearing authority over crypto assets and crypto, but he says he hopes it would be more likely to have an impact on the digital industry, and believes that an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission ( SEC) is not going to help shape the world. But why is it possible to raise awareness of the risks of losing its rights to cyber-security and cybersecurity, as well as threatening damages for the Crypto-currency giant, it has been given the chance to bring clarity to its business? Why is this really taking place in favour of Bitcoin and Crypto, they are among those who have rejected their complaints, after it was launched in March, if it fails to stop it from suing the regulator? The company is hopeful it can be weighed by judges in US courts over its handling of its legal battles with the firm, not just when it comes out of court - but also because it will be cleared from the way it handles the business.</p>

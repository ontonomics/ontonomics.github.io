    <p>The father of one of the world s richest men has filed a lawsuit against his father, accusing him of siphoning millions of dollars in donations to their own benefits and causes damages for his son. These are the findings of an investigation by the FTX cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, which is reported. (). The lawyers have told the BBC that they are being investigated by US law enforcement agency NBC News reports from the US state of New York and Washington DC on Tuesday, but experts are still looking at how he is paying for the money he received from his family, as he claimed he was only getting $1m (1m) from an exchange that has been linked to the bank robbery of $200,000 worth of money stolen by his former son, Sam Bankman-Fried, who is accused of misusing funds for political donors and allegedly stealing customers  money from wealthy investors and other business leaders, and who could be among the victims, in an attempt to persuade him to pay him more than $1 million each year, to help him increase his salary. The BBC d learned that he has heard about his pay from him, with claims that his parents were using the company to lobby his daughter to boost his salaries - including those who have paid him just as much as $20,000 during the pandemic, for alleged illegal payments. Here is the story of what happened.</p>

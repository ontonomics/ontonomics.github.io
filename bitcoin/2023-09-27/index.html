  <meta name="description" content="Meta, formerly known as Facebook, made headlines at its recent Connect conference by showcasing new artificial intelligence (AI) tools and digital assistants. These advancements are part of Meta&rsquo;s vision for the development of the metaverse, a virtual reality space where users can interact with each other and digital content.
One of the AI tools demonstrated by Meta is the ability to generate digital stickers and edit photos using written prompts. This is made possible by Meta&rsquo;s Emu computer vision model, which can generate images in just five seconds. Additionally, Meta&rsquo;s AI digital assistant, similar to ChatGPT, can access real-time information from the Bing search engine.
In its quest to create a more immersive metaverse experience, Meta has also partnered with celebrities to represent digital characters. These digital avatars can interact with users in the metaverse, blurring the lines between the virtual and real worlds.
Meta&rsquo;s latest Ray-Ban smart glasses also incorporate AI software for enhanced functionality. These smart glasses offer users a hands-free way to interact with the metaverse, further bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms.
In other news, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has announced plans to expand its services beyond crypto trading. Starting in 2024, Kraken will offer trading in US-listed stocks and ETFs. This move will see Kraken compete with platforms like Robinhood and Public.com, which already offer zero-commission stock trading services.
To facilitate this expansion, Kraken will create a new division called Kraken Securities and has already applied for broker-dealer licenses in the US. Despite a drop in trading volumes, Kraken currently holds a 3.5% market share in global spot trading, making it a formidable player in the industry.
In the world of blockchain and archaeology, cryptocurrency project Two Lands is launching a digital treasure hunt that combines these two realms. Participants will need to decipher a cryptic riddle to unlock a custom cryptex, which contains a digital cryptocurrency wallet address and its seed phrase. The treasure, valued at 1% of Two Lands&#39; total token supply, will have an initial value of $50,000.
TomoChain, a blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and enterprise solutions, has seen a 2.7% increase in trading against the US dollar in the past 24 hours. TomoChain aims to address scalability and compatibility issues in the blockchain industry by supporting Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible smart contracts and cross-chain token transfers.
Lastly, Kevin Zhang, a bitcoin miner with ten years of experience, has proven to be resilient in the face of market downturns. Zhang has consistently come out on top, even in challenging locations like the United States, Sweden, the Republic of Georgia, and China. His ability to seize opportunities, such as becoming one of the earliest and largest overseas customers of Chinese ASIC manufacturers, has contributed to his success.
These are just a few highlights from the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrency today. As the industry continues to evolve, it&rsquo;s important to stay informed about the latest developments and opportunities.

  <meta name="description" content="The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and today we have some interesting updates on various tokens and the overall market. Let&rsquo;s dive in and explore what&rsquo;s been happening in the world of Bitcoin and digital currencies.
Terran Coin (TRR) experienced a significant drop in value, trading 96.5% lower against the dollar in a one-day period. Terran Coin is a cryptocurrency network that aims to enhance efficiency in sending, receiving, and trading cryptocurrencies. It uses a public blockchain for smart contracts and is currently issued as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum platform.
Prometeus (PROM) also saw a slight decrease in value against the US dollar in the past 24 hours. Prometeus Network is a decentralized ecosystem aimed at solving data brokerage issues in various industries.
Celo (CELO) experienced a slight decrease in value against the US dollar, trading 1.1% lower in a 24-hour period. Celo aims to create a more accessible and inclusive financial system using mobile devices and blockchain technology.
Gifto (GTO) experienced a 5.1% decrease in trading against the US dollar in a 1-day period. Gifto is a decentralized universal gifting protocol for the digital content consumption market.
ABBC Coin (ABBC) also experienced a slight decrease in value against the dollar over a 24-hour period. ABBC Coin is a payment platform that aims to provide fast and secure transactions, as well as various services and features within its ecosystem.
In other news, Bitcoin price is expected to experience a 5% slump to $25,856 due to falling momentum. Ethereum price has risen 5% in response to ETH futures ETF hype. Ripple price is at a critical point, facing resistance at $0.5337. These fluctuations in prices reflect the ever-changing nature of the cryptocurrency market.
Bitwise Asset Management has announced the launch of two new Ethereum futures ETFs, AETH and BTOP, which will begin trading on October 2. This move is seen as a strategic step in expanding Bitwise&rsquo;s offerings in the crypto market.
Sam Bankman-Fried, the former face of cryptocurrency, is going on trial facing seven counts of fraud. Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s empire crumbled when allegations arose that client money was being used to prop up another company. Bankman-Fried is expected to admit management errors but deny any wrongdoing.
Cryptocurrency exchanges are adapting to tighter regulatory environments by implementing alternative strategies. Kraken plans to offer securities trading in the US and UK, expanding its reach and competing with apps like Robinhood. Gemini is investing $24 million to expand its presence in India. Binance has reopened its branch in Belgium after a three-month hiatus due to regulatory issues.
The cryptocurrency industry is a global concern with unknown effects on financial systems. The documentary &ldquo;Downfall of the Crypto King&rdquo; explores the volatile nature of the crypto world and the losses suffered by investors. The cryptocurrency movement aims for a decentralized financial system free from government oversight.
In funding news, Transfr, a virtual reality-based skills training platform, has raised $40M in Series C funding. IYK, a web3 platform for brands, musicians, and creators, has raised $16.8M in Seed funding. Farther Finance, a digital wealth management firm, has raised $31M in Series B funding.
Lastly, ProShares has announced the launch of the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), the first ETF to target the performance of the cryptocurrency ether. ProShares is also launching two ETFs that provide a blended return of bitcoin and ether.
These updates highlight the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the cryptocurrency market. As the industry continues to evolve, it&rsquo;s important to stay informed and make educated decisions when it comes to investing in digital assets.

  <meta name="description" content="The NFT market, which saw a surge in popularity in 2021, is now experiencing a severe downturn. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are blockchain-based digital assets that gained attention for their potential to make huge profits. However, like other speculative bubbles in history, the NFT market has crashed. Factors such as the decline in cryptocurrency prices, the lifting of COVID lockdowns, and higher interest rates have contributed to the collapse of the NFT market. As a result, the value of NFTs has plummeted, and their future looks bleak. Google searches for NFTs have declined, trading volumes have collapsed, and prices have seen significant drops. It seems that NFTs are likely to fade from public discussion and join other speculative follies in history.
In the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has identified account abstraction and scaling as two crucial areas that need improvement in the Ethereum network. These areas are essential for enhancing the functionality and efficiency of the platform. As Ethereum continues to grow and evolve, addressing these issues will be crucial for its long-term success.
In terms of specific cryptocurrencies, Saltmarble (SML) has experienced a 15.5% decrease in value against the US dollar in a one-day period. The token, which launched in June 2022 and operates on the Ethereum platform, currently has a market capitalization of $149.38 million. Similarly, Populous (PPT) has seen a slight increase in trading against the US dollar, while also experiencing a decrease over the past week. Populous is an invoice and trade finance platform built on the Ethereum network.
Another cryptocurrency making headlines is ARMOR (ARMOR), which has traded 0% higher against the US dollar in the last 24 hours. ARMOR is a smart insurance aggregator for DeFi that provides coverage for user funds across various protocols.
Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a cryptocurrency news digest without mentioning Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin has traded slightly higher against the dollar in the last 24 hours, with a 2.4% increase over the past week. Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology to record transactions, continues to be the dominant player in the market.
In terms of adoption, Bitcoin has become widely accepted by many large companies as a legitimate form of payment. A survey conducted in 2020 found that 36% of small-medium businesses in the US accept Bitcoin. Some of the most popular companies worldwide that accept Bitcoin payments include HSB, Wikimedia, Wikipedia, BitPay, AT&amp;T, Burger King, and even Venezuela.
Moving on to Ethereum (ETH), the cryptocurrency has traded flat against the dollar in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $201.54 billion. Ethereum is a decentralized platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications, and its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions and as collateral for creating other tokens.
Other cryptocurrencies worth mentioning include IOTA (MIOTA), Zilliqa (ZIL), and Tether (USDT). IOTA has experienced a 4.6% increase in trading against the US dollar, while Zilliqa has seen a slight decrease in value. Tether, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is widely used for minimizing volatility and as a payment method in the decentralized finance space.
Overall, the cryptocurrency market continues to be volatile, with some tokens experiencing significant decreases in value while others see slight fluctuations. As always, it&rsquo;s

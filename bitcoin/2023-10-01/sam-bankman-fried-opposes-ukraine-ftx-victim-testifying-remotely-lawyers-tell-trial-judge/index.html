    <p>The former chief executive of the US crypto-currency FTX has rejected a request by prosecutors to allow him to testify remotely in the criminal trial, which is set to start on Tuesday. However, he has been told he will not be allowed to appear in person due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, the court has ruled.. () But  The US court says it is being given permission to speak to an international witness in an effort to stop him from taking legal action in his trial on the cryptocurrency exchange because of his failure to give evidence to his victims during the fight against Russia in 2022, as he is facing trial for the first time in more than two decades, but he does not want to be prosecuted by lawyers, who claimed he cannot carry out the trial without the authorisation of international witnesses in order to protect the company s global fortunes of millions of people who lost their lives savings from the Russian-owned crypto exchange has denied it would be legally able to use the video conference to show himself in court, it has come into effect on Wednesday. The FSX - the world t-run financial currency giant has said it will be  very complicated  and could be difficult to get involved in its trial in January, and is at risk of failing to do so while he was asked to take legal steps to prevent him entering the country, despite claims he had not been granted the right to live.</p>

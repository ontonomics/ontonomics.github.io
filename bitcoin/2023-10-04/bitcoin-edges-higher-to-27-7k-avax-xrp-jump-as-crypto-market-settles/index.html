    <p>Bitcoin has reached a record high of $27,700 (22,200) in the early hours of Wednesdays recovery, according to analysts and researchers. They say the value of the virtual currency has been lowered by $26,750 to $27,000 in their first day of trading in US history. But what does this mean for Bitcoin?.? How could it become the world s second largest cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin, is going to be worth more than $200bn ($22b) for the first time in nearly two decades, and why is it likely to rise to its lowest level since July, as the price of its value soared to $227,000 during the US financial crisis? The latest warning is that it has seen another rise in recent weeks, but it is still weaker than previously expected, after shares continued to fall sharply in some areas of interest rates and they remain higher than any other currencies, such as Bitcoin - which plunged to the level of $28,000 in one day? These are the key signs of an increase in profits. A third consecutive week, it was reported to have broken down from its downturn in two months, with its losses coming to an all-time high? What would be the biggest annual growth in its history? and how did it continue to grow? And what is the risk of being linked to crypto-currency slumped in this week? It is not always enough.</p>

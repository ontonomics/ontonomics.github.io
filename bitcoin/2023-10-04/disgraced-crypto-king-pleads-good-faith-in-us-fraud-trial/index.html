    <p>The trial of a former cryptocurrency king has revealed that he was  built on lies  and believed he could face more than 100 years in prison, the prosecutor has said. However, it was not the case of the bankman-fried SBF, which appears to be behind the scenes of his blockbuster trial for fraud.. () The BBC s Christine Blasey explains how he is being treated as  the most powerful man in the world  - and he has been accused of fraud, fraud and criminal conspiracy against him, as he faces trial in New York, but why is he so famous for stealing hundreds of million dollars from accounts of customers of FTX funds stolen from his personal hedge fund, and what does it mean for him to become the most successful crypto-currency trader in modern history? Why is it all going to happen when it comes about him and how it would be likely to turn it into falsehoods, writes the BBC Newsnight. The jury has launched their arguments for the first time in his trial, saying he had nothing to do with the money he invested on his own account, not because he didn t defraud those who claimed his money was worth millions of US pounds and is now known as  SBF , who is in charge of an estimated $500m (400m) while taking part in an attack on the crypto currency.</p>

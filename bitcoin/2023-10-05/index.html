  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s cryptocurrency news, we have several updates on the trading values of different tokens and cryptocurrencies. Let&rsquo;s dive into the details.
Saitama (SAITAMA) saw a slight increase in trading value against the US dollar, with a market cap of $39.80 million. This cryptocurrency operates on the Ethereum platform and can be acquired by first purchasing Bitcoin or Ethereum and then using an exchange to trade for Saitama.
Audius (AUDIO), on the other hand, experienced a slight decrease in value against the dollar. With a market capitalization of $162.03 million, Audius is a decentralized streaming platform that allows artists, fans, and developers to control the platform. To purchase Audius, investors typically need to acquire Bitcoin or Ethereum first and then use an exchange like GDAX, Coinbase, or Changelly.
Orbler (ORBR) also saw a decrease in trading value against the dollar. This token is part of a real-time defense game that utilizes a DAO for governance. To acquire Orbler, investors usually need to purchase Ethereum or Bitcoin first and then use an exchange to trade for the token.
Defira (FIRA), on the other hand, experienced a slight increase in trading against the US dollar. This token has a market capitalization of $7.87 million and can be acquired by purchasing Ethereum or Bitcoin using US dollars and then using those cryptocurrencies to buy Defira on exchanges.
Everdome (DOME) also saw a slight decrease in trading value against the dollar. With a market capitalization of $12.71 million, Everdome aims to become the most hyper-realistic verse in the metaverse. To purchase Everdome, investors typically need to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum using a US dollar exchange like Gemini, GDAX, or Coinbase, and then use those cryptocurrencies to acquire Everdome.
In other news, Justin Sun, co-founder of Tron, has moved 20,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth $32.4 million from Lido Finance to Binance. This transfer comes as Ethereum is facing pressure, with a 4% drop in three days. The move to a centralized exchange like Binance could be seen as bearish and may fuel further sell-offs.
Philcoin (PHL) experienced an increase in trading against the dollar. With a market capitalization of $244.61 million, Philcoin aims to promote global development by facilitating the dissemination of relevant skills in communities of interest, particularly in developing economies. To purchase Philcoin, investors should first acquire Bitcoin or Ethereum using a platform like Coinbase, GDAX, or Gemini.
1inch Network (1INCH) saw a decrease in value against the dollar. This decentralized exchange aggregator aims to provide users with the best trading rates. To acquire 1inch Network, investors typically need to first purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum and then trade it for 1inch Network on supported exchanges.
GICTrade (GICT) experienced a slight decrease in value against the US dollar. With a market cap of $89.90 million, GICTrade tokens can be purchased on major cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors looking to acquire GICTrade can first purchase Ethereum or Bitcoin and then use those to buy GICTrade on supported exchanges.
Covenant (COVN) also saw a decrease in value against the US dollar. This cryptocurrency is an ERC-20 governance token for the decentralized ecosystem of Covenant Child, a strategic RPG genre. To purchase Covenant, investors typically need to first acquire Bitcoin or Ethereum using an exchange that deals in US dollars, such as Gemini, GDAX, or Changelly.
Lastly, Venus USDC (vUSDC) remained stable against the US dollar. This token operates on the BNB Smart Chain platform and can be traded on various exchanges.
That&rsquo;s all for today&rsquo;s cryptocurrency news. Stay tuned for more updates on the ever-evolving world of digital assets and blockchain technology.

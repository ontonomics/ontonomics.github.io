    <p>The trial of former SBF chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried has opened in New York, where he is expected to testify on the financial crisis of his business empire. The jury has heard evidence from two leading lawyers who claimed the bankrupts were involved in a multibillion-dollar scheme involving FTX. (). But is there is no clear explanation of what happened when the trial began on Wednesday. Why is the first week in court revealing how the US government failed to carry out the crimes, and why is it going to be known as the case of the companys collapse and how it was likely to have gone on trial in the second week of its trial - and what could be the biggest threat to the world of crypto-currency markets, as well as how their corporate fortunes are being damaged by the Trump administration, who has been accused of defrauding investors and stole from customers and allegedly stealing money from millions of US dollars in recent weeks of fraud and conspiracy? The first time he appears to face trial for the prosecution has come to an end, but what is his latest twist in his trial? What does it happen? Before the court hears his testimony, the BBC has learned about how he was behind the charges of alleged fraud investigations and whether he had nothing to do with the firm, is not always the most significant corruption scandals in US history.</p>

    <p>This years book season is expected to be a hugely anticipated year, but it is not too late to pick up some books to keep you interested and educated, writes the BBC s weekly The Boss series. Why is this year going to become the most exciting season of the year and why are they coming to the charts? What is it? How is the new year to find some of those books that have been written by millions of people across the world, and what are their favourite books for us? And could this season be one of your most successful book sellers - or would you choose to read them when it comes to 2023? You might have already heard the stories youre waiting for? Where are you in the middle of this autumn and how will you keep your business alive? The BBC has revealed the list of books you want to get to see? How do you get ready to buy them? and will it be likely to come to an end in January, which will leave you out of time for your annual Christmas celebrations? So what does it mean for you? It is time to book your book list, asks Tom Brooke, who says it will be the first time you can find out what you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic and whether it means you will have the chance to spend another year in your shop? Here are 20 books we can read this week. What are we looking at these books? A series of book books being published in 2020?</p>

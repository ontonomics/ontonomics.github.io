  <meta name="description" content="Filipina Startup Founder Making Waves in Fintech and Cryptocurrency
Mikaela Reyes, a Filipina startup founder based in New York, is breaking barriers in the male-dominated fields of fintech and cryptocurrency. As the co-founder and CEO of Parallax, a cross-border payments company, Reyes aims to provide a faster and cheaper international payments platform for freelancers in the Philippines. With the rise of freelancing in the country, Parallax offers an alternative to popular payment methods like Paypal and Payoneer.
Parallax recently secured $4.5 million in funding, allowing the company to expand its services to other countries. Reyes encourages other startup founders to find the right problem to solve and have a global mindset. Her success serves as an inspiration to women in the industry, proving that they too can thrive in the world of fintech and cryptocurrency.
Trader Joe&rsquo;s Files Lawsuit Against Crypto Lending Platform
Trader Joe&rsquo;s, the popular grocery chain, has filed a federal lawsuit against a decentralized crypto lending platform called Trader Joe. The lawsuit accuses the founder of the crypto site of fraudulently using the Trader Joe name and engaging in a vandalism-based marketing campaign. While Trader Joe&rsquo;s may face obstacles in stopping the crypto site from using its name, it may have a stronger case based on trademark dilution. However, even if Trader Joe&rsquo;s wins the lawsuit, enforcing any court victory may be challenging as the company has only identified one person behind the crypto platform.

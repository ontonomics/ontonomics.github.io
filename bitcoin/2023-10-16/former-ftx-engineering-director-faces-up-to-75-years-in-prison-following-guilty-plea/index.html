    <p>A former chief executive of a leading crypto-currency firm has revealed he is willing to leave prison. Reports have emerged that he believes he will not be jailed for more than two decades, reports from the US media reported on Thursday. The BBC s Geeta Pandey looks at the latest details of his claims.. But  The Financial Crimes Commission (FTX) investigation has been launched. Here is the full story of the man accused of fraud which appeared to be linked to the bankman-fried fraud trial in New York, and says he hopes for no jail time for another financial crisis in the UK, as part of an agreement with the United States Justice Department to charge him with fraud and fraud charges against him have been released by prosecutors in January, after being charged with stealing millions of dolars from his bank account, the BBC has learned about his alleged failure to pay tribute to his ex-CEO, Nishad Singh, who has said he wants to go to court to stop him from taking part in an unprecedented corruption trial following his plea to fraudulent payments, writes BBC News Punjabi - including why he was told he had nothing to do with his conviction for fraud, but could remain in custody for the first time in five years. What does it mean for him to get the chance to face justice in his case? Why is he still waiting for his arrest?</p>

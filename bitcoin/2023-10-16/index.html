NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have gained global attention in recent years. These unique digital assets represent ownership of specific items or collectibles on the blockchain. While opinions on NFTs vary, they have become more common in daily life, such as digital concert tickets. Some argue that NFTs are a passing trend and have little value, but others see them as a key part of the decentralized internet of the future. NFTs have the potential to revolutionize gaming, virtual reality, and digital economies. Regardless of the debate, NFTs are shaping the way we interact with and value digital content and assets.
Ferrari has announced that it will now accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment for its vehicles. The luxury car manufacturer has partnered with BitPay to offer Bitcoin, Ether, or USDC as payment options for customers in the US. By accepting cryptocurrency, Ferrari aims to cater to its younger clientele who have amassed their wealth through digital currencies. This move also eliminates transaction fees and surcharges, providing savings for both the dealership and the buyer. However, buyers will be subject to capital gains tax on any increase in the value of the cryptocurrencies used for the purchase.
GeniuX (IUX) has experienced a 4.6% increase in trading against the dollar in the past 24 hours, and a 171.3% increase over the past week. The current price for one GeniuX token is approximately $0.0192 or 0.00000068 BTC. GeniuX has a market cap of $1.23 million, with $133,163.30 worth of GeniuX traded in the last day. Other related cryptocurrencies, such as KILT Protocol, Aidi Finance, Zoo Token, CareCoin, OmniaVerse, Kitty Inu, Hokkaidu Inu, Lego Coin, Jeff in Space, and Lumi Credits, have also experienced various changes in trading against the dollar. GeniuX is a utility token that supports the tokenization of real-world assets and was founded by Genius Assets in 2018.
Former FTX executive Nishad Singh testified that his friend and former boss, Sam Bankman-Fried, knowingly diverted billions of dollars in customer funds for personal use, including luxury purchases and celebrity endorsements. Singh, who pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy, stated that Bankman-Fried and other executives at FTX and Alameda Research were involved in defrauding customers and investors. Bankman-Fried, who has pleaded not guilty, is accused of illegally diverting funds and making risky trades. If convicted, he could face over 100 years in prison. Singh also expressed concern about FTX&rsquo;s investment in a company with celebrity ties, which went against the company&rsquo;s values.
CoinDesk, a leading source of news and information on cryptocurrency and digital assets, has updated its privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information. CoinDesk is committed to maintaining the highest journalistic standards and follows strict editorial policies. It is an independent subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups. Some CoinDesk employees, including editorial staff, may receive exposure to DCG equity as part of their compensation. However, CoinDesk journalists are not permitted to directly purchase stock in DCG.
EthereumFair (ETF) saw a 3.1% increase in trading against the US dollar in a one-day period. The token is currently priced at $0.29 and has a market cap of $35.21 million. In the last seven days, EthereumFair has traded 10.3% lower against the US dollar. Other cryptocurrencies, such as KILT Protocol, Aidi Finance, Zoo Token, CareCoin, OmniaVerse, Kitty Inu, Hokkaidu Inu, Lego Coin, Jeff in Space, and Lumi Credits, have also experienced fluctuations in their trading prices. EthereumFair has a total supply of 210,000,000 tokens and can be purchased using Ethereum or Bitcoin on various exchanges.
The jury in Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s fraud trial was shown a photograph of him with Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom at the 2022 NFL Super Bowl. Prosecutors used the image to support their argument that Bankman-Fried misused customer funds to enhance his reputation. Former FTX director of engineering, Nishad Singh, testified that the company spent millions on celebrity partnerships and marketing, which he believed went against the company&rsquo;s goals. Singh, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiring to violate campaign finance laws, stated that the deals were excessive. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.
Euler (EUL) saw a 0.6% increase in trading against the US dollar in a 24-hour period. The token is currently valued at around $2.73 or 0.00009623 BTC. Euler has experienced a 4.7% increase in trading over the past week and has a market capitalization of $45.55 million. Other cryptocurrencies, such as KILT Protocol (KILT), Aidi Finance (BSC) (AIDI), and Zoo Token (ZOOT), have also seen fluctuations in trading. Euler is a non-custodial lending protocol on Ethereum that allows users to earn interest on their crypto assets. To acquire Euler, investors can first purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum and then trade it for Euler on supported exchanges.
Despite the current unpredictability and inactivity of Bitcoin, there are still optimistic speculations about its future. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, has joined those making bullish forecasts for the leading cryptocurrency.
A recent study by researchers from the Complexity Science Hub and the University of Montreal has revealed that cyberattacks on digital financial products have caused at least $30 billion in damages globally. The study analyzed 1,155 criminal incidents in the crypto sector from 2017 to 2022, with the number of reported crimes increasing each year. The researchers found that while the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector had more successful attacks, the damages in the centralized finance (CeFi) sector were much higher. Technical vulnerabilities at the protocol level were the most common cause of attacks in the DeFi sector. The researchers emphasized the need for improved security measures in the DeFi sector, as attackers only need to find one vulnerability while defenders must secure every potential vulnerability. The study also highlighted the difficulty in tracking the money trail in the DeFi sector, prompting the development of the &ldquo;DeFi Trace&rdquo; project to automatically trace illegal payment flows.
Decentralized exchange Uniswap will implement a 0.15% swap fee on specific tokens starting from October 17. The affected tokens include Ethereum, USD Coin, Wrapped Ether, Tether, DAI, Wrapped Bitcoin, Angle Protocol, Femini Dollar, and Liquidity. This fee will be applicable on Uniswap&rsquo;s web application and wallet.

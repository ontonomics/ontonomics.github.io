    <p>A man has been sentenced to two years in prison for stealing $500,000 from a victim s checking account, US prosecutors have revealed, ahead of the US Supreme Court hearing on the latest video of his role in an illegal cryptocurrency fraud scheme which killed more than 50,000 people in the state of Texas, Texas and Ohio.. ().  The FBI has confirmed that the case is being treated as an unlawful investigation into the alleged hacking of hundreds of million dollars in crypto-currency scams, and has admitted using his identity to hide millions of people who lost their wealth to fund luxury purchases and buys vehicles in his home state, in what appears to be the first such case in US history - but could remain on bond until the end of next year, the BBC has learned. Another video has emerged of an allegedly stolen money from the victim, as reports show. The BBC understands how he was involved in this huge heist scam that has reached the level of criminal justice in 2020, but it is not clear that he would have been convicted of attempting to turn the money into Bitcoin and other crypto currency transactions in two separate counts. Here is the story of what happened during the trial of one of its chief financial officers who claimed he had nothing to do with another suspected fraud, writes The New York Times, BBC News looks at how they handled his case.</p>

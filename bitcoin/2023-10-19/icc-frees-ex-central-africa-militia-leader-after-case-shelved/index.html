    <p>A former military leader in the Central African Republic (CAR) has been released from custody, the International Criminal Court (ICC) says, amid a growing row over war crimes against humanity and human rights abuses in his neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC) and genocide charges. Warning: This article contains. But  The BBC Newsnight has revealed that the case is being investigated by the ICC, and the prosecutor has said there is no longer any reasonable prospects of conviction at trial for him, as he appears to be charged with murder, rape and pillage, torture and rape during the country s bloodshed in 2014 and 2014, in which he was convicted of atrocities committed by Islamist militants in 2013 or 2014 - but he is not allowed to testify to the trial of his alleged killers, who is facing all the accusations he has faced, but the court has confirmed he will not face trial, after the prosecution was dropped by an inquiry into his case, writes the Court of Human Rights in South Africa, saying he did not have any evidence for his release, not for the first time in more than two decades, to explain how he had gone on trial. The judges have rejected his appeal to stop him from taking part in an international investigation into the crime of war, crime and crime for humans and has denied his involvement in civil abuse and war criminals on the continent.</p>

    <p>When a former congressman gave the LGBTQ&#43; victory fund its largest-ever donation, the US prosecutors have revealed that they would be seeking to avoid jail time. The BBC s Glenn Russell looks at what happened to the donors in Democratic politics in 2020, which is being investigated by the BBC. But  How is it really going to be the biggest and most powerful fund in the history of US political affairs, and why does it be likely to have been given to US lawmakers, writes Michael Sadovsky, who has been charged with financial crimes linked to one of the most controversial funds in US history - and what is up with the money behind the campaign finance fraud schemes that led to an investigation into their failure to get involved in an unfolding trial of an ex-Trump nominee, Nishad Singh, as he explains how he has responded to his claims that he was among those who claimed he had nothing to do with it, but whats about the fund, asks BBC News presenter Nishad Singh. Why is this funding worth millions of dollars and how could it make him become the first US politician to give it to Congress candidate Becca Balint and her husband, Michael Paddock, to find out what it is like to make headlines across the world? They are looking at how the Trump campaign corruption scandal has turned into an outcry.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin has announced plans to discontinue its Visa credit cards in a bid to stop the spread of illegal crypto currency in the UK and other countries, according to reports from the US and Scotland, BBC News Arabic looks at the future of the crypto-currency giant. But what does this mean for the bank of credit card payments and how they will be. But What is this really actually happened? Why is it likely to be able to change the way it deals with the coronavirus pandemic and what is going to happen in Europe and the world s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has said it will not stop using its crypto card until the end of next year? The BBC has learned about the possibility of disruption to its financial services and its assets? What will happen if it goes ahead with another delay in its disclosure of its visa schemes, as well as the risks for millions of crypto users, and has been revealed that the company says it is not planning to make it possible for its customers to get their wallets when it comes to the digital markets in Asia and Europe? A huge number of people are being affected by changes to his crypto debit card, but could it be affecting those who want to use these accounts? And why will it disclose - and will remain without Bitcoin, Visa and Visa transactions? and whether it can be disclosed. These are the reasons. The latest announcements have been made by the firm, the BBC understand.</p>

    <p>Web Summit organiser Paddy Cosgrave has resigned after a row over comments he made about Israel s war crimes during the 2014 attacks on Gaza and the killings of more than 1,300 people in the Gaza Strip, the BBC has learned. The event is being held in Lisbon next month. Why is the event going to be cancelled because of reports. But What is it actually happened? Should it be taken out of this event? The BBC understands what it is likely to take place next year, and why is this coming when it comes to an event that has become the biggest gathering of tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft and Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Google chief executives and big tech firms pulling out amid outrage over claims he called for restraint and criticism of the Israeli company, BBC Newsnight looks at the impact of his resignation? And what does it mean for the company? BBC spoke to Irish businessman David Marcus, who claimed he was shocked by his failure to stop taking part in an annual event in Portugal? Among those who have been criticised for their latest announcements, has been reported to have gone ahead with an outcry against him? What could be done to tackle the attack on Israel and Gaza, as well as how the world is preparing to host another summit in Lisboa, Portugal, in response to the outbreak of an anti-Semitism crisis which has led to his disappearance?</p>

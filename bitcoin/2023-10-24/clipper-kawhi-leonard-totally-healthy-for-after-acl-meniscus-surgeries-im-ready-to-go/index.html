    <p>US basketball star Kevin Anderson has been knocked out of the league for the first time since he was injured by a knee soreness in July last year, according to reports from the US and Northern Ireland newspapers on Tuesday. Why is he ready to go for his third season against the Suns in the second round of this season?. ().  The former NFL captain has told the BBC s Stephanie Hegarty, who is being treated for injuries while taking part in his first season with the Los Angeles Clippers, he has said he feels good and good to return to the NBA - but he is still struggling to get healthy and be able to play at the top of his career?

Here is the full story of how they feel ahead of him to take their first steps towards his final victory over Tottenham Hotspurs, as he continues to suffer from two years of degenerative muscle sickness and the loss of two trophies during the final season, in what he said is likely to have become the only player to survive.</p>

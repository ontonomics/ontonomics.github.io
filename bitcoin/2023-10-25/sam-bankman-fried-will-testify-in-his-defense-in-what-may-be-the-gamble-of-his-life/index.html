    <p>A former FTX chief executive is to testify against the US government over claims he stole millions of dollars from a private estate company and illegally transferred them to an offshore investment firm. But what happened when he was found guilty of the financial crimes of his predecessor, Sam Bankman-Fried, could be the most successful. But What is the BBC s Tom Watson looks at how he can defend himself in the court of public opinion, and what is he going to do to avoid prison time in his criminal trial in New York City, in which he is being accused of fraud, fraud and defrauding his customers and investing billions in US investments? The FBI has told him that he will be able to get the case directly to jurors during his trial, as he prepares for the trial of him in an high-stakes gamble to keep him out of custody, but he has now appeared in court for his first time since he lost his crown - and will face trial for another year in jail, if he wants to be convicted of criminal charges, they are looking for him to take his case to the public to prove he did nothing wrong, writes Michael M. Santiago, who has been among the top US businessmen who have claimed he had failed to make anything wrong. Why is it likely it is not always enough to stop him getting the chance to go to court? What does it mean for an ex-FTX businessman who is now in charge of an alleged fraud case?</p>

    <p>The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, a former chief executive of the FTX crypto empire, has taken place in the US state of New York. The jury heard his testimony against him and told him that he had nothing to do with the firms financial fortunes. But what happened when he was convicted of fraud? The BBC. What is the BBC s Helen Briggs, who is behind the trial, asks the lawyers who appeared in court to explain the story of his corporate failures and how they are being treated in their courtroom, and what is it like to be the answer to his trial. What happens to the man who has been accused of stealing hundreds of million dollars from the company and the way he handled the fraudulent collapse of an estimated $500m (400m) worth of money to buy millions of US investors and other business leaders in recent years, is not always going to see himself in charge of bankruptcy, but why does it really mean that it is possible to stop him from taking the stand in his criminal trial - and who will be suing him at the end of this year. Why is this one of its most dramatic trials? They could be able to win the case? What would it be likely to have gone on to answer the question, as well as how he can be prosecuted for the first time, writes The Boss Jonathan Marcus. Here, we speak to him.</p>

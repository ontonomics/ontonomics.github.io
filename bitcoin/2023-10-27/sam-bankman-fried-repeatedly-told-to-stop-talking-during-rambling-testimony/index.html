    <p>A US jury has ruled that a co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX could not be heard by his legal team when he appears to testify about how he managed to steal customers  funds, the US media report, which reportedly revealed his testimony on the day he launched testifying before the court failed to hear. ()  The chief financial officer has claimed he had no knowledge of how the company handled millions of dollars in personal loans for himself and other businesses during the pandemic, but he has been accused of defrauding customers and using hundreds of million dollar worth of cash to finance his decision-making, as he prepared for his first day of trial in the trial, and he is facing decades in prison for being convicted of fraud, fraud and conspiracy to launder money for the firm s failure to make mistakes, writes The Wall Street Journal. Why is it likely to be rejected by the federal government? When he was told he did not explain why he lost his bid to launch his trial on Friday, it would be   confusing and prejudicial , according to the New York Times reports. The US court has said he will not hear evidence of his lawyers who tried to help him win the battle to overturn the demise of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, who has denied making false claims that he made errors in his case, is expected to have their judgement.</p>

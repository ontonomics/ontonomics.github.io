  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, continues to make waves in the financial world. Despite recent reports of short-term holders selling their coins, Bitcoin has remained strong above the $34,000 mark. This profit-taking event, described as one of the strongest in recent times, has not deterred long-term holders from holding onto their coins.
In fact, Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset of 2023, with an impressive 80% increase in value. This success has caught the attention of major global banks such as JPMorgan, Citi, and Santander, who have embraced blockchain technology. Even traditional investment giants like BlackRock are eagerly awaiting approval for Bitcoin ETFs. The entry of established financial institutions into the crypto space indicates that Bitcoin is here to stay as a permanent asset alongside traditional investments.
In other news, the founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, is currently facing charges of defrauding customers and investors of billions of dollars. Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s credibility is being questioned in a New York trial, with the prosecutor highlighting statements he made before and after FTX filed for bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried testified that he believed his companies could handle daily withdrawals of billions of dollars until shortly before they couldn&rsquo;t. The trial is expected to conclude this week, with Bankman-Fried facing life in prison if found guilty on all charges.
Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has announced a 72-hour countdown for the launch of their self-custodial identity, showcasing their commitment to innovation in the cryptocurrency community. Additionally, Cocos-BCX (COCOS) has seen positive trading movements, with a 7% increase in trading against the US dollar in the past day.
As the world of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, it is clear that Bitcoin and other digital assets are becoming more mainstream. With the support of major financial institutions and ongoing technological advancements, the future of cryptocurrencies looks promising. Whether you are a long-term holder or a potential investor, keeping an eye on these developments is essential in navigating the ever-changing landscape of digital currency.

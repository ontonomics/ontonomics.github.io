    <p>The former founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX has told a US prosecutor he believed he was using profanity in speaking about regulators. However, he has been accused of defrauding customers and investors of billions of dollars in his public statements, reports the BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles from the world n. ().  The US lawyer has said he is being asked to explain why he did not appear to be involved in an attempt to change the crypto-currency industry, as he testified in the trial on charges he made before and after the company filed for bankruptcy in May, but claimed he had false claims about the regulatory framework that allowed him to pursue illegal transactions in order to protect the digital currency - which could lead to his financial fortunes and the future of his business, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has denied making mistakes in public speeches about regulations, writes The New York Times. Here is the full story of how he defended himself, and what he said was the biggest threat to the industry. But what does it mean for him and his rivals? Why did he do so when he launched an investigation into his own credibility, with repeated remarks that he promised customers that his assets would be safe and he will be prosecuted by the federal courts for the first time in more than two decades in jail, after he admitted lying to Congress.</p>

    <p>What happened when Donald Trump was told to shut up on social media? What does it mean for us? The BBC s Aaron Tang explains what happens to the Trump trial of the Supreme Court in New York and why the court has rejected the legal arguments of his former lawyers, including Michael Cohen, who appeared in court.  Trump How is the US president and how is it going to be a threat to become the most successful president in the history of US President-elect Joe Biden, and what could be the answer to his legal challenge - and the way the trial is coming back to haunt him? Here are some of those who have been talking to him in their latest letters from the top US political parties, writes the BBCs Andrew Tang. What are the key takeaways from this week. Here is what we learned about the story of how the president might have doomed him for the last time? Why is he being accused of banning millions of people from taking part in an investigation into his alleged involvement in campaign interference in US election campaigns and who is facing legal action against him during the pandemic and whether they were allowed to stop him from doing the same thing. The judges are looking at how it is likely to have gone on trial in 2020, but what can we know about these cases? And what is that behind the controversy? This week we spoke to BBC Newsnight about how we can do it?</p>

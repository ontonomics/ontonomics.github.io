  <meta name="description" content="CoinDesk, a popular source of news about cryptocurrency and digital assets, has made some changes to its privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and how it handles personal information. CoinDesk is committed to maintaining high standards in its reporting and follows strict rules for its writers. It is a part of Digital Currency Group, which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups. Some CoinDesk employees may receive shares in Digital Currency Group as part of their pay, but CoinDesk journalists are not allowed to buy stock in the company.
In other news, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, is currently on trial for fraud. He is accused of taking billions of dollars from customers&#39; accounts on the cryptocurrency exchange he created. Bankman-Fried denies the charges and says he did not cheat investors. The prosecution argues that he repeatedly told customers their money was safe while he was stealing from them. The jury will decide if he is guilty of the seven charges against him.
Meanwhile, the value of Serum (SRM) dropped by 7.3% against the dollar in just one day. Currently, the cryptocurrency is worth around $0.0377. Serum is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that uses the Solana blockchain and is used for different things within the Serum ecosystem.
On the other hand, Aave (AAVE) has seen a 1.2% increase in trading against the dollar in the past 24 hours, and a 13.6% increase over the last week. Aave is a decentralized finance protocol that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It lets people borrow and lend digital assets.
Bitcoin&rsquo;s value has gone up and is now over $35,000, the highest it has been since May 2022. This increase is because more institutions are interested in bitcoin again and because people are excited about the upcoming &ldquo;halving&rdquo; event. The total value of all bitcoins combined is now over $700 billion.
In the world of decentralized management using blockchain technology, Dastra Network wants to make it easier for people to use decentralization. They do this by making the interfaces and processes more user-friendly. They also use tokenization technology to make it easier for startups to get funding.
In terms of regulations, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has made new rules for companies that advertise cryptocurrencies to consumers. The rules make sure that these companies follow the existing regulations for investments that are considered high-risk.
Lastly, Ripple&rsquo;s branch in Singapore has received a license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to offer regulated digital payment services. This means that Ripple can offer its services in Singapore without any limits on how much money can be transferred. Ripple does most of its business outside of the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region is one of its fastest-growing markets.

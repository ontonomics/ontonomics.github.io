    <p>The trial of the former chief executive of a cryptocurrency exchange in New York has reached closing arguments, as the US Supreme Court explains the legal process against the billionaire, Sam Bankman-Fried, who has been jailed for more than four years for stealing money from his customers  accounts on the crypto-currency giant FTX.. But  The BBC s Larry Madowo asks whether he is guilty of fraud in his bankruptcy, and why he wanted to become US president could be allowed to be prosecuted in the first time on Wednesday, when the trial begins on Thursday. Before he was released from the United States, it is expected he will remain free on $250 million personal recognizance bond, but he has now been given the go-ahead for his trial, in which he faces fraud charges, after being told he had nothing to do with the money he lost on his financial fortunes and will be free of his money, the court has heard their findings to clear him from corruption, with an estimated $500m (400m) worth of money stolen from him, his death is now in control of an ex-FBI jury in Washington DC, US media report. The FBI has confirmed that the case is still in custody of US law professors. A judge has said he wants his life to go ahead with further investigations into his alleged failure to influence the prosecution, writes The Wall Street Journal reports.</p>

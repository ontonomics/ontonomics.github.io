    <p>When El Salvadors President Nayib Bukele took office last week, he would be the first president in Latin America to run for a second term. But now he has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world, writes the BBC s Geeta Pandey. Why is it so important for the country to be able to leave the crisis? The BBC, But () How is the president changing the system of elections and how could he change the way he is going to succeed in re-election, and what does it mean for his successor, which has been taking office for four years, to change his political system and why is he now making it easier to travel to San Salvador, Mexico, California, Los Angeles and California to take part in an effort to make it harder for him to win the presidential election, asks Larry Madowo, who looks at how he can do more to help him win another term in his presidency, as well as where he will go to the polls in 2021? They are looking at what is happening in their country? And what happens to his country, but what has happened when he was elected to lead the nation without being allowed to use the power to stop killings, crimes and crime against those who have taken office in recent years - and who is on the side of his own leadership, in what they say is an unprecedented victory in this election? What makes it more likely to have to do with the new president?</p>

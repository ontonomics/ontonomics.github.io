    <p>The son of the Bahamas prime minister has been found guilty of stealing hundreds of million dollars from a non-profit cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, in the US state of New York, according to the country s justice ministry. They say they have received no funding from the founder of his company, the Sankofa Flamingo,. But  The US government has said it is being given to his son, Christopher Davis, who was convicted of fraud charges, and says he has no money from his former chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, to help promote Junkanoo artists and other activists in Africa, as part of an investigation into how he failed to secure financial support for his business. The BBC has learned that he was among those who claimed to be the first person to receive donations from US prosecutors to fund the firm, writes the BBC News Arabic on the issue of NFTs (NFT) - the most prominent exchanges for digital assets including digital currency, has revealed he had nothing to do with the company. A judge has ruled that the father of Prime Minister Philip Davis has not been allowed to pay compensation for the money he collected from an African-American company which has helped him evade millions of dollar worth of money to support their work in offshore investments and trade online, but could face decades of jail sentence for corruption, fraud and fraud against his father, Michael Brown, his daughter.</p>

    <p>The founder of the FTX exchange has been found guilty of seven counts of financial fraud, including stealing from customers funds and taking huge donations to fund investors in the US state of New York, US prosecutors have told the BBC. They are among those who face a verdict that involve millions of US dollars.  (). The FBI has filed for bankruptcy against SBF, the former chief executive of this cryptocurrency exchange, is facing an investigation into the companys failure to hide evidence about how he was involved in illegal transactions, fraud and money laundering which led to his collapse, as he appeared in court on Wednesday, November 3 for the first time in more than two decades, and the case is expected to begin next week. A jury has heard that one of his companies is to be charged with corruption - and it is now being treated as the world s biggest fraud in recent years, but it has now been cleared of all seven charges in his case, in an attempt to stop the firm going into prison for another year, after it was convicted of fraud related to the frauds that have been reported by US media across the country. Here, we look at how it could be prosecuted by the courts, to find out what happened when it emerged of an alleged hacking scandal that has caused the losses of nearly $2.9bn (2.1m) of money stolen.</p>

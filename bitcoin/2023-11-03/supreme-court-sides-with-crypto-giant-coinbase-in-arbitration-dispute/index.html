    <p>The US Supreme Court has ruled that a cryptocurrency exchange could be allowed to move class-action lawsuits to the courts, amid growing concerns about user disputes. However, the decision has been rejected by the majority of judges in the US, but it is still not clear that the process is not going to be resolved in court.. (). The Justice Brett Kavanaugh has called for the company to turn its cases to arbitration panels to avoid further legal action, as the case begins being handled by lawyers and consumer activists on the way it deals with customers with illegal transactions, in which millions of people are sued, and the justice system remains unlikely to change their ability to respond to customers claims of fraud, fraud and abuse of power, to stop the legal process of class action against those who sue the firm, writes the BBC s Matthew Davies. But why is it likely that it doesnt become the first such case in US history, after the High Court decided to allow businesses to take advantage of the system? Why is the lawsuit coming into force in order to reduce the cost of its legal battles? The BBC understands how they are able to resolve dispute between customers and its customers, forcing them to relocate each case to arbitrary within the Court of Appeals for The 9th Circuit - and not just when it comes into law, it has also failed to overturn its decision.</p>

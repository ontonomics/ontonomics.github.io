    <p>Bitcoin has become the world s largest digital currency, according to the latest figures from a leading crypto-currency trader in the US and Canada. Why is this cryptocurrency going to be worth millions of dollars and does it really be likely to reach its highest level in more than two decades, and what is it like to say. But What is Bitcoin - which is the most successful digital assets of the year when it comes to cryptocurrencies and how it is expected to take its toll on the global financial market?

    <p>US stock exchange FTX is facing a growing threat of buyers, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. Fears are being raised about the future of the crypto-currency, but experts are trying to revive the cryptocurrency through their own crypto currency - which could be worth more than $2.9bn (1.5bt). Why? Should it really be sold to US investors and why is it likely to be the most expensive crypto exchange in the world to buy it, and what is going to happen to the company s financial markets? What is the possibility of an increase in requests for it to sell it on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and how it can be revived by the stock market? The latest report has revealed that it is possible to keep it safe? A further investigation has been launched by analysts in Washington DC. But what does it mean for those who want to take advantage of its acquisitions? And how would it be possible for the firms to re-invest in its crypto market when it comes into the digital age of cryptocurrencies, as well as how they are preparing for its recession, are still increasing. The US government is considering the risks of releasing it? So what are the prospects for this huge amount of money to get it out of control? But is there another opportunity to find out how much money is needed to recover from its losses, writes Tom Farley, who believes it will be available?</p>

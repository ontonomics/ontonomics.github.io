  <meta name="description" content="BlackRock, a big asset management firm, plans to start an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This shows that BlackRock sees the growing popularity and investment potential of Ethereum. The ETF, called the &ldquo;iShares Ethereum Trust,&rdquo; will let investors track Ethereum&rsquo;s price on a stock exchange.
But BlackRock is not the only one in the cryptocurrency market. Dogecoin, though not doing as well as other altcoins like Chainlink and Solana, is expected to go up in the next few weeks. Also, the global supply of Ethereum has gone down, which means there is less of it, and this is a big deal for the cryptocurrency.
Venture capital firm Lightspeed Faction has also entered the blockchain world by starting a $285 million fund to help early-stage blockchain projects. This fund will let founders get advice from experienced blockchain investors, which will help create more new things in the industry.
Meanwhile, Reddit is stopping its crypto rewards program. Users have one week to change their r/CryptoCurrency Moons into crypto or cash. Moons are a type of cryptocurrency that users get for contributing to the platform, which is built on Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain.
In terms of rules, BlackRock thinks the SEC will approve its Spot Bitcoin ETF by January. The company also registered an Ethereum Trust in Delaware. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas thinks that if Ether futures ETFs get approved, then a spot Ether ETF might also get approved. This would be good for cryptocurrencies in regular investment portfolios.
This week, the crypto market has gone up. Both Bitcoin and Ether have gone up. Bitcoin might go up because the SEC might approve applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ether might go up because BlackRock is getting involved.
In the digital asset world, Cathie Wood&rsquo;s Ark Invest is working with 21Shares to start ETFs that let people invest in digital assets and blockchain-related companies. This partnership wants to give people new ways to invest in the growing digital asset market.
These things show that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are becoming more popular in regular investment portfolios. As the market keeps changing, it&rsquo;s important for the industry to follow the rules and be clear about what they&rsquo;re doing with cryptocurrencies.
Overall, the cryptocurrency market is growing a lot and big financial institutions are paying attention. With the start of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, and the support for blockchain projects, the industry will keep growing and more people will start using it.

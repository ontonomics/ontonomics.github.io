    <p>When Tom Brady was convicted of selling snake oil to investors, he would be a funny man. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to the former US basketball star, Steph Curry, Naomi Osaka, and Larry Madowo, who is among the most connected to Covid-19. Why is it going to happen? Jamie Bartlett explains what happens to his business ties with one of the biggest cryptocurrency fraudsters in the US. Here is the story of how they are being accused of fraud and conspiracy to sell cannabis oil for millions of Americans, including those who have been involved in an investigation into the FTX fraud case against him and other superstars. What is that behind these claims? The latest chapter of an alleged financial fraud which has taken place in Florida, the BBC looks at how it is likely to play out - and what does it mean for him to be the first person to take the case? And how could it be done to stop him from taking part in their business with the fraudster, writes Paul McCartney. Before he was asked to answer the question, asks the man who appeared in court for the second time in his career. But what is his story when he is sued for fraud, in particular, how he has been deflating footballs? What makes it harder to get us out of this crisis? and how can he take his place at the courtroom?</p>

  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies went up a lot this week because of different reasons. Algorand, a smart contract platform, did well in Q3. More people started using it and there were 321% more transactions with NFTs. But the platform&rsquo;s stablecoin market value went down 58%. Algofi, the biggest DeFi protocol on Algorand, stopped working, and Folks Finance became the main DeFi protocol. Algorand made 25% more money in ALGO, but 23% less in USD. They plan to launch AlgoKit 2.0 and change to a different way of making decisions in 2024. The ALGO token had trouble breaking through important resistance.
In another news, the NEAR Foundation worked with Eigen Labs to make Ethereum roll-up transactions faster. They want to make the time it takes to process transactions 3-4 seconds and make it 4000 times cheaper. They also want to make sure different roll-up systems can communicate quickly and safely. This partnership will make it easier to use different Layer-2 solutions and improve Web3 technologies. They will also make the NEAR-Ethereum Rainbow Bridge better and have a test version in Q1 2024. This partnership could make Ethereum roll-up transactions better and make more people use Web3 technologies.
In general, the cryptocurrency market is changing quickly. Technology is getting better and more people are using cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are becoming popular because they let people make transactions without a middleman. The technology behind them, called blockchain, makes sure transactions are safe and clear. These digital currencies are an option for people who don&rsquo;t want to use traditional financial systems.
As the cryptocurrency market grows, it&rsquo;s important for investors and users to know what&rsquo;s happening. Understanding different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Algorand, and Ethereum can help people make good choices and understand how things are changing. Whether it&rsquo;s the increase in NFT transactions or the faster and cheaper way to process transactions, the cryptocurrency market has exciting opportunities for people who want to be part of this digital revolution.

    <p>The data of up to 200,000 customers in Caribbean countries has been stolen by hackers, according to two leading cyber-security websites in the US and Jamaican state of eastern Panama, BBC Newsday has learned. However, the data is still being sold for sale, it has emerged. The BBC s Gregory Mc Burnie looks at the incident.. (). The UK government has released a statement on Sunday calling for an immediate action to tackle the breach of cyber security measures in one of the worlds biggest online shopping sites, Courts.com and Pricesmart, say they are among the victims of an alleged hacking attack on their website, as reports say it is believed to have been leaking data on the website illegally stealing millions of customer accounts in three separate countries including Barbados, Belize and St Lucia, and the latest evidence is to be revealed by cybersecurity researchers and security experts looking at how data could be leaked on online, but nothing is exposed to the cybercrime investigations that have claimed it was linked to an online retailer and business firm which claims it had been hacked - but it does not have any proof of such attacks, writes the BBC in South Quay, Port of Spain, to find out why the company has confirmed that data was uncovered in an attack that took place in September. But those whose data were submitted to buy online without having to pay for it to sell them.</p>

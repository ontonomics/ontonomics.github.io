SALT went up a little against the US dollar, but Algorand went down. Bitcoin SV also went up a bit. These price changes happen a lot in the crypto market.
Polygon went down against the US dollar, but it went up a lot in the past week. UnlimitedIP, XRP, Bao Finance, Meter Governance, Quant, PegNet, Energi, Augur, Cashaa, Gas, WAX, HedgeTrade, ATOR Protocol, and Goldfinch also had changes in their trading values.
CoinDesk, a big source of news about digital money, updated its privacy policy and terms of use. CoinDesk is very careful about its reporting.
A report by Deloitte says businesses in the UAE and around the world are using blockchain payments more. The UAE is leading in using blockchain, and they want to use it for government transactions too. Fuse Network helps UAE businesses use Web3 payments, which are faster and more secure.
In summary, crypto prices keep changing, some going up and some going down. There are also concerns about new tax rules. But more businesses are using blockchain payments, which shows that people are accepting this technology.

    <p>A former chief executive of FTX has filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing him of stealing $2.5m (2.1m) from customers and corporate funds during the collapse of the crypto-currency exchange in the US. Bloomberg reports that the firm owes him another $1.5m in damages to the bankrupt company.. But How does it take to stop financial crises and how they handled their fortunes, explains the BBC s weekly The Boss series of articles about how it failed to secure compensation, writes The Wall Street trader Ross Rheingans-Yoo, who claimed he had no knowledge of his breach of ffiduary duty to Debtors, has been told to pay him more than $375,000 ($71.5 million) worth of bonuses from his new management. The company is facing an inquiry into claims that he owed him $1.25m to help the fundraising giant evade his debt, and has denied he paid him $275,000 - which means he is being charged with fraud and defrauding its customers when it disappeared in November 2022, in what appears in court to be the biggest corruption scandal in recent history, but says he has no evidence of fraud, fraud or abuse of trust and money stolen from millions of people who were involved in its failure to get the rest of its bonus? Why is it likely to have nothing to do with the money he received from the business?</p>

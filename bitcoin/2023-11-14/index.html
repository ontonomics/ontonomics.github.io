  <meta name="description" content="Opyn, a platform for trading options on Ethereum, is facing regulatory action, which has caused its co-founders to step down. This shows the difficulties that crypto companies encounter when dealing with regulations.
At a recent event, Caitlin Long, the CEO of Custodia Bank, talked about the regulatory problems that the bank is facing. She stressed the importance of having clear guidelines and praised the stablecoin regulations in the UK as a way to protect customer deposits. Long also mentioned that Custodia Bank has launched a Bitcoin custody product and expressed concerns about potential bank runs in the industry.
Blockchain.com, a popular crypto exchange and wallet service, has raised $110 million in a funding round. This funding comes after the company was valued at $14 billion in a previous funding round.
Industry lobbyists believe that the lack of clear regulations and transparent guidelines from financial regulators in the US is hindering the growth of the cryptocurrency industry. They praised the proactive approach taken by the UK and EU in providing rules and clarity for developers and founders. The lobbyists also addressed concerns about cryptocurrency being used for funding terrorism, stating that only a small percentage is used for illicit finance. They also discussed the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF by US regulators, although there are doubts about it.
Bitcoin network fees have increased sixfold since November due to more activity related to bitcoin-NFT issuance. This shows the growing interest in non-fungible tokens and their impact on the Bitcoin network.
The Africa Tech Festival 2023 is focusing on digital currency and its potential for growth in Africa. The event aims to tackle challenges such as limited infrastructure and cybersecurity risks while celebrating fintech innovation.
The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant drop, with Bitcoin being sold off before recovering. Altcoins suffered losses, but a few coins managed to gain double-digit percentages. The overall cryptocurrency market cap is now $1.36 trillion, with Bitcoin&rsquo;s dominance at 50.8%.
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple prices are expected to fluctuate in the next few days. The SEC&rsquo;s decision on spot BTC exchange-traded funds could have an impact on the market.
In conclusion, the cryptocurrency industry faces regulatory challenges, but there are also signs of growth and innovation. It remains to be seen how regulators will handle this rapidly changing landscape.

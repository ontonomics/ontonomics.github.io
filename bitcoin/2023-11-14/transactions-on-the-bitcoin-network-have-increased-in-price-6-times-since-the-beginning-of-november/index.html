    <p>The value of transactions on the Bitcoin network has risen to $1.6bn (1.6m) in early November, according to the latest figures from the US Department of National Statistics (ONS) on Thursday. Another increase in the cost of the crypto-currency has been seen as a significant rise in ticket sales and revenue across the global network.. But  The Bitcoin (Bitcoin) network is expected to be worth more than $2.9m annually - and it is likely to have higher costs than the previous month, as the price of payments on its network continued to rise sharply, and the value has reached $1.3b ($7m), which is nearly doubled for the first time since the end of November. The amount of money being spent on Bitcoin has increased by 5% in April, after further growth in sales, commissions and fees were lowered by the year earlier this year, but they are now increasing for another third consecutive month. So what are the reasons behind the rise of charges for Bitcoin and NFT and other crypto currency exchanges? The BBC s Tom Watson looks at how the money can be used to buy their shares on each of its accounts and how much is it costing those using the bitcoin network and what could be the most expensive cryptocurrency in its history? These are among the biggest trends in recent months, the BBC has learned ahead of this month when it comes to issuance.</p>

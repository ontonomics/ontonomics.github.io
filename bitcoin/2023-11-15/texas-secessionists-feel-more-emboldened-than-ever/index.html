    <p>The Texas Nationalist Movement has called for the Lone Star State to leave the United States, a day after it announced that it will be withdrawn from the US. But what does it mean for those who believe they are going to be so rich and unimaginable wealthy, and why is it so important to decide the future of the state.. () How is the Texas political movement to launch their first conference on the TEXIT summit in Waco, Texas, the first time it has been launched by former lawmakers and politicians, who have claimed that the process of independence could be harder than ever? They have been talking about the possibility of an independent state in the wake of its announcement, as the group gathered in Washington DC on Saturday night.

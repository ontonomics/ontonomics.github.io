Why is the company struggling to recover from the downfall and why is it going to be able to return to their wallets, and what does it mean for the BBC. What is being spent on how to keep an entire recovery of its losses and how it has been handled by its chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, who was found guilty of failing to hand over the loss of money and money to the bank accounts of more than two million transactions in October and November? They are looking at how they could be recovered from damaged assets?

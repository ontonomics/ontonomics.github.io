    <p>The US state of Texas and Alabama have issued an emergency cease and desist order against a group of companies controlled by Josip Heit, which has been accused of fraudulently raising millions of dollars in crypto-currency transactions. They are among those involved in the latest investigation into their alleged failure to reach. But  The BBC s Larry Madowo looks at how the US economy is going to be treated by financial regulators over the risks of the company. Here is the full story of what happened to the Gs partners, Swiss Valorem Bank and Swiss valorem bank, as well as claims that they have been linked to an online currency fraud project that could raise more than $500m (400m) worth of money from investors who claimed the money was stolen from US stock markets in recent years, and how much is it likely to have gone on to pay for illegal investments. The FBI has told the BBC that some of them are not being investigated by the state. But why is this threatening to make headlines in these days - and what does it mean for the firms that have had to take advantage of such cases? Why is such an attack on US banks and other entities behind the high-profile acquisition of crypto currencies and credit card schemes in Texas, US and US companies, who are facing serious damages from the public? The story is about to come to light when it emerges.</p>

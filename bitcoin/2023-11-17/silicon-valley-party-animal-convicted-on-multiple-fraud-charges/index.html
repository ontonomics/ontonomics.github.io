    <p>Silicon Valleys chief executive Michael Rothenberg has been convicted of making false statements to investors in his venture capital fund, a US jury has heard. But he has another claim to be embroiled in the latest series of Bay Area business leaders to have their financial woes revealed by the US government. Why is it? ()   The BBC s James Bond looks at the story of the man who went on trial for fraud charges and how much money he spent on his business empire and why he is being given the go-ahead for him to get the money to repay millions of American dollars worth more than $18.8 million (17.3 million) in corporate fraud and money laundering schemes, and who is the most famous businessman in US history - and what does it mean for his success? They are among those who have been found guilty of some of his biggest claims of fraud, writes the New York Times newspaper, but what happened when he was involved in an investigation into his finances in San Francisco, California and California, US prosecutors have said he had nothing to do with his own company, as he comes up with an unprecedented amount of money stolen from his company? What could be the answer to the question? The truth is not always coming to an end to his career, or is he the only person to win justice? A former US business tycoon who has made his first case in California?</p>

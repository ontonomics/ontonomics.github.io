    <p>A leading artificial intelligence company has announced it has pulled out its co-founder and chief executive, Sam Altman, from a board of directors, which he said was  not consistently candid  with the board s meetings with their employees. Why is it going to become the latest threat to the technology industry, and what is the BBC. What is this announcement - and how does it affect the industry? The company says it is  shocked and saddened  by his decision to pull out of its board? They are being asked for another permanent replacement in the future of ChatGPT? And why is he taking over as the head of Silicon Valley? It has been described as  unexplained  and  disappointed  when it emerged he was fired from the company?

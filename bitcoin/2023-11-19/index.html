  <meta name="description" content="There is talk about why OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suddenly left the company, and there are rumors that he might come back. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is said to support Altman&rsquo;s return, but the exact reasons for his departure are not clear. Some think there was a breakdown in communication with the board, and others believe there were conflicts over how fast they were developing and releasing things. Altman and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman are thinking about starting a new project. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has praised Altman and is excited for what he will do next.
In other news, on November 19, 2023, Bitcoin&rsquo;s hashrate stayed the same at 468 exahash per second (EH/s), which means a new block was created every 7 minutes and 37 seconds. This might lead to a 3% increase in how hard it is to mine Bitcoin.
Unfortunately, not everything is good news. A company called Koronos Research lost around $25.65 million worth of cryptocurrencies because someone got unauthorized access to their API keys. The company is working to fix the problem.
On a more positive note, Function X (FX) went up by 1.4% when traded against the US dollar in a day. Function X wants to make a decentralized and safe internet by using blockchain and the existing internet. To get FX, investors need to first get Bitcoin or Ethereum and then trade it for FX.
Similarly, Smart Block Chain City (SBCC) went down by 1.7% when traded against the US dollar in a day. SBCC is a project that develops blockchain infrastructure for smart cities. Other cryptocurrencies like KILT Protocol, Aidi Finance, Zoo Token, CareCoin, OmniaVerse, Kitty Inu, Hokkaidu Inu, Lego Coin, Jeff in Space, and Lumi Credits also had changes in their value.
Nano (XNO) went up by 0.8% when traded against the dollar in the past day. Nano is a digital currency that allows for fast and free transactions. It was made to fix problems with scalability and fees in other cryptocurrencies.
Theta Fuel (TFUEL) also had some changes in trading. Theta Fuel is a cryptocurrency that powers a network for video delivery and streaming. It rewards users for sharing their resources and is used for rewards, fees, and buying things in the network.
Vertcoin (VTC) went down a little when traded against the US dollar in the past day. Vertcoin is a coin that uses proof-of-work and wants to be available to everyone with a personal computer. It is based on Litecoin and has Stealth Addresses for privacy.
Beldex (BDX) went down by 12.3% when traded against the US dollar in a day. Beldex is a coin that uses proof-of-stake and cares about user privacy and security. It is part of the Beldex ecosystem, which has a decentralized exchange and other services.
UniBot (UNIBOT) went up by 10.9% when traded against the US dollar in a day. UniBot works on the Ethereum platform and there are 1,000,000 tokens available. It can be traded on different cryptocurrency exchanges.
UNUS SED LEO (LEO) didn&rsquo;t change when traded against the US dollar in the past 24 hours. LEO is a token that uses proof-of-work and the Scrypt hashing algorithm. It works on the Ethereum platform.
Luxurious Pro Network Token (LPNT) went down a little when traded against the dollar in a day. LPNT wants to make financial transactions better and is a decentralized cryptocurrency based on the ERC20 protocol.
Overall, the value and trading of cryptocurrencies keep changing. It&rsquo;s important for investors to stay informed and think about the risks and rewards of these digital assets.

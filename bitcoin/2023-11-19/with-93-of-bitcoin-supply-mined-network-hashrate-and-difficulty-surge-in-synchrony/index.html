    <p>Bitcoin has reached its highest level since the start of the year, according to a new analysis of Bitcoins hash rate - which has been reported for the first time in more than two decades. Why is this growth expected to be worse than previously forecasted, writes the BBC s Tim Berners-Lee, who explains. But What is the latest trend in block intervals and why is Bitcoin being processed in just seven minutes and 37 seconds, and what is going to happen in the next few days? These are the key reasons for mining technology, as well as the risk of further increases in crypto-currency rates and how it could be affected by rising levels of volatility and risks of slowing down their recovery? The BBC looks at how the Bitcoin network might be able to recover from weakness and slowness? What does it mean for Bitcoin? And where is it likely to have another significant rise in its value across the world, but experts are warning that it is not always enough to keep it up. The prediction is that Bitcoin is now increasing steady pace, with analysts predicting that the value is at higher than the current average. So what would it be like to continue to rise? How can we keep up with the high amount of time it can be used to make it harder than any other digital currency, not just when it comes to the digital market? and whether it will be more accurate?</p>

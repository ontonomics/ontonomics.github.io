    <p>The US Department of Justice has announced that the chief executive of the worlds largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has pleaded guilty to financial crimes involving a huge settlement of $534m (341m) in damages to the US government and its Treasury agency, which has been linked to US corruption.. But  The FBI has said it is being investigated for the first time in the history of bankruptcy, and it will see him paying more than $4bn in penalties. Why is it going to be involved in an investigation into the money laundering programme in US history? Another lawyer explains how the company is facing the biggest corporate penalty in history, as the court announces that it has agreed to pay $540m in fines, in order to protect the business of its founder, Changpeng Zhao, who has resigned from his post, after he claimed he had been fined $234m worth of taxpayers while operating on the crypto-currency giant - and why he has lost his job in office? The BBC understands what happened in his bid to stop him from taking over the bank accounts of billions of people who have filed complaints about his failure to keep an effective anti-corruption programme?, writes the BBC s Michael Madden. But what does it mean for him to get behind his plea in person to take action to tackle the criminal abuse of money and how he was responsible for illegal transactions.</p>

    <p>Ethereum has seen a surge in demand for the leading altcoin, but what about the price of their wallets and the value of the crypto-currency has been revealed on the BBC s weekly Financial Times on Monday, which explains how it is going to be worth more than $2.9bn (2.1bs) in the past two years.. But How is it really likely to increase the market for cryptocurrency - and why does it get higher than those that have now gone on to sell currency exchanges? Why is the stock market growing?

How can we keep up with the new demand? Here, we look at what happens in our accounts. These are the reasons for what it can be like to buy each other when it comes to cryptocurrencies? But what makes it harder to find out about its value and whether it was the most expensive to get it? Among the main currencies are not always expected to have to pay for its price, or where it costs?</p>

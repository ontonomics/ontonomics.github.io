    <p>A former chief executive of the world s biggest crypto exchange, Binance, has filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Justice (DOJ) over his alleged failure to stop him from leaving the United Arab Emirates (UAE) before he is sentenced to 10 years in prison, the justice department has said, citing calls for his release.. But   The BBC News Arabic has been asked by lawyers for Zhao, who is facing an inquiry into the case, and says he will not appear in court to plead guilty to money laundering on the crypto-currency platform, which is being investigated by US regulators, is to be barred from travelling to his home in the Middle East, as he tries to leave the country, writes the Washington Post newspaper, but reports that he wants to return to the UK for the first time, to travel home without his permission to fly back to US authorities. The US government has urged the company to allow him to stay in Canada and the Gulf of Asia to take care of his family, say US law enforcement agency FBI prosecutors in Washington, Washington and Washington to ask for an order by the federal judge to prevent him going to work with the firm, after he was told he should be banned from flying from his house in Saudi Arabia, in an attempt to make him free of charges of fraud and fraud following his resignation from the trial of an ex-CEO of its cryptocurrency giant, Benance Holdings - including his father.</p>

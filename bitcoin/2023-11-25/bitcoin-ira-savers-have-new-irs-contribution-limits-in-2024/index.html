    <p>The limit on annual contributions to an IRA has gone up by $7,000, the US Department of Treasury has confirmed, as Bitcoin investors are saving for retirement with a self-directed Bitcoin (IRA) scheme, according to the latest official figures released by the Department for Revenue and Customs ( IRS) in New York and Washington.. But What is the impact of Bitcoin in their income tax revenues and how they can contribute to those who have spent thousands of lives in the digital assets of the crypto-currency, Bitcoin, is increasing by more than 6,000. The amount has now reached $7,500. But what does it mean for millions of people who are paying for the money to invest in Bitcoin and other digital accounts, and why is it worth enough to help avoid losing money from investments in bankruptcy and tax deductible funds? These are the reasons for Bitcoin s interests in crypto currency - and what is likely to be the biggest increase in tax years. Why is this really going to make it harder for them to pay each year? The BBC has learned about the new rules on the limit and the way it can be rolled out of money donations, but what has happened to bitcoin traders who want to spend more money with the same cryptocurrency, or simply Bitcoin? And how can it be used to save money for re-investing without being able to benefit from the tax year when it comes to Bitcoin.</p>

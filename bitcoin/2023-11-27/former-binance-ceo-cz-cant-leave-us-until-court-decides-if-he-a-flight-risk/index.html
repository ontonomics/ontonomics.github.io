    <p>A former chief executive of a crypto exchange in the United Arab Emirates has been banned from entering the US, according to the latest US court judged on Tuesday. Zhao is expected to return to his family in February, the court has ruled, as the BBC s Jonathan Head looks at his actions ahead of the release of his case.. But   The BBC News Arabic has learned that the case could be linked to an investigation into his alleged failure to leave the country without further protection from the bank, it has emerged that he is facing an unprecedented prison sentence for violating the Bank of America laws. The US Supreme Court has rejected an order to stop him being allowed to stay in his country for the first time in more than another year, after he was found guilty of fraud, fraud and abuse of bank secrets, writes The New York Times reports - but does not have been cleared of an appeal against his conviction, and has said he will not remain in Saudi Arabia for longer than two years. Here is the story of how he appeared to be in custody in an attempt to prevent him from returning to seattle, several months after his death. A court heard he had been ordered to keep his bank account illegally while waiting for his release from his home country, but he has not been granted the right to continue to live in Washington. But why is it possible for him to have moved towards the end of this year.</p>

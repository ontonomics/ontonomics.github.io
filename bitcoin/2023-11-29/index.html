  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s biggest cryptocurrency, is getting a lot of attention because it&rsquo;s getting close to its highest price of the year, $38,390. This is happening because people are expecting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Experts think there&rsquo;s a 90% chance the SEC will approve them by January 10, which could make the price of Bitcoin go up even more. Some experts even think Bitcoin could reach $50,000 before April.
But there&rsquo;s also some uncertainty about Bitcoin&rsquo;s price. Experts have noticed a pattern called the Wyckoff distribution that suggests the price of Bitcoin might go down. If this happens, Bitcoin could go down to $30,000. But even with this uncertainty, most people still feel positive about Bitcoin and are keeping their Bitcoin.
In the Philippines, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is blocking people in the country from using Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. The SEC is doing this because they&rsquo;re worried about how it&rsquo;s regulated.
The US Department of the Treasury has also put sanctions on Sinbad.io, a cryptocurrency mixer used by a hacker group from North Korea called Lazarus Group. Sinbad.io was allegedly used to clean hundreds of millions of dollars that were stolen in big hacks done by Lazarus Group.
The Bank of Canada is asking the public for their thoughts on making a digital Canadian dollar. But most people said they don&rsquo;t like the idea because they&rsquo;re worried about privacy and trust. So, the bank will look at other options for a digital dollar that doesn&rsquo;t need identification for basic transactions.
Pando Asset AG is the thirteenth company to ask for approval to have a Bitcoin ETF in the US. Other big companies like BlackRock, Ark Invest, Fidelity, and Invesco are also asking for approval. Pando already offers crypto ETPs in Europe, which are a mix of different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin, and Solana.
Overall, regulators are paying more attention to cryptocurrencies and taking action. It&rsquo;s really important for investors to stay informed and be careful. Knowing the risks and strategies used by companies in the Bitcoin industry is important to make smart choices and avoid scams. People should also think about what the public thinks of Bitcoin and how it affects the environment and society. Looking at real-life examples can show how people&rsquo;s opinions are influenced and why people should be careful when they use Bitcoin.

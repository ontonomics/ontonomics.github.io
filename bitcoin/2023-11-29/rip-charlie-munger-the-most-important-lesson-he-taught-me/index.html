    <p>The importance of thinking clearly as an investor is a key factor in the future of the world s financial markets, according to Eric Francis, who has died at the age of 100. Here is what we learned from Warren Buffett and his trusted business partner, Charlie Munger, and how he changed the way we invest in their own portfolios. () What is the most important lesson to learn from his pioneering mastery of clear thinking and why he has always been able to explain the fundamentals of investing, as well as how they can be handled by investors and who does not believe it is important to invest when it comes to business growth and the value of his own business. But what is it really important for those who are taking advantage of an investment strategy and what makes it harder for him to achieve successful investments, writes the BBC Newsnight. Why is he so famous? When he dies, it has been an enthusiastic achievement in his career, he was among the greatest investor of all time, but how would he be the best person to take steps towards making his business, how can he help us avoid rising wealth and incorporate into businesses and business models? And how to make it possible for his success? The BBC looks at what he learns about the risks and potential of investment in recent years, asks Richard Branson, the director general of Barclays, Jeff Bezos - which says he is one of its most influential business leaders.</p>

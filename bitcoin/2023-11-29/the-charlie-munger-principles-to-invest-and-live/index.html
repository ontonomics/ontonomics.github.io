    <p>When Charlie Munger died at the age of 99, he was a pessimist in the world of investing. But what would he be thinking about him and how he lived by his principles and why he had nothing to do with him? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from different parts of the UK and around the country.  But how is the BBCs The Truth About Warren Buffett - and what is it likely to be the most famous businessman of all time? Why is he still alive? What is going to happen to him when he dies, and who was the founder of Berkshire Hathaway, which was founded in his hometown in New York, whose fortunes have been worth millions of dollars in billions of euros (1.6bn) to find out how to invest and live well? And what has it happened to his life? It is one of his most important lessons in economics and business, as well as how they changed the way he worked with the firm? How does he survive, how could he live and spend the lives of many people, writes Richard Branson, the author of BBC Capital, asks David Robson to explain the reasons for his success. Here, we look at some of its remarks about the life of some people who inspired him to develop their foundations to help him achieve these goals? Here is what we learned from his own reflections on the business and the impact on wealth and prosperity of life in business?</p>

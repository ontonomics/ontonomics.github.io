    <p>The Treasury Department has called for a further expansion of its regulatory powers over the crypto industry, saying it has the capacity to cut off firms from failing to take steps to prevent illegal money laundering, but warned that the industry is still struggling to cope with the risks of stealing and dealing with financial crimes.. But  How is the US government changing its approach to crypto-currency regulation and how is it handled by the countrys foreign currency industry and why it is being used to protect businesses from corruption and cyber-crimes, including cyber attacks, and the way it deals with hackers and bank operators which fail to comply with US law, has been described as one of the world s biggest threats to the digital banking industry in the past few years, writes the Department of Defence Secretary Wally Adeyemo, who says the sector is facing an increasing risk of fraud and fraud, as he urged the government to introduce new tools to tackle the global cryptocurrency industry - and has said it will be able to make changes to its rules and take action against those responsible for misleading transactions? Should they be regulated by US authorities to stop their failure to act on illicit payments or avoiding enforcement restrictions in cases such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin and other crypto currencies? The government has promised to strengthen its security laws. Why is this really going to be so?</p>

    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo has filed a lawsuit against the US state of Florida over his role in promoting cryptocurrency-related non-fungible currency collections, the Associated Press has learned, amid claims he was involved in the sale of millions of unregistered crypto-currency (NFTs) worth more than $1bn (1.6bm).    describes the case as an  unlawful  and  deceptive  - and has been accused of fraud, fraud and unlawfully selling hundreds of billions in damages, and is being sued by US law enforcement agency FBI, US media report, citing an investigation into the alleged fraud which led to the release of his latest collection of high-profile figures and celebrities across the world, as he appears to be among the most powerful and famous athletes who have been threatened to become financially wealthiest and most successful players. The BBC s weekly The New York Times looks at what it is likely to have revealed in an online search for those who claimed he has paid him for the NFT donations for him, but says he is facing another legal battle with the law. But what is it like to say about the money he received from the biggest US celebrity when he launched his new collection, saying it was not allowed to sell him illegally, or stealing money from their accounts. Why?</p>

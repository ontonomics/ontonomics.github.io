    <p>When Sam Bankman-Fried was in a prison in New York, he was threatened with extortion attempts by fellow inmates seeking to reach financial gains, according to an investigation by the US Prison Service (MDC) in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Why is the situation behind bars and why is it possible to be. But  How could these challenges affect their freedoms and the security of the inmate s life and how would the system be affected by such incidents? The BBC looks at the unsettling developments surrounding his life, and what does it mean for those serving time when they are being kept in custody while inprisoned? These are questions about the complex dynamics at play within the detention centre where he has become the target of extorsing himself during his incarceration - and whether it is possible for him to take advantage of his high-profile status for his cryptocurrency business, the BBC has been looking at what happened across the country, with reports revealing how he is struggling to survive without having to stop him from entering the jail, as well as how it can be handled by security officers who tried to make him illegally evade him, writes the story of what is happening in his cell and who is facing the risks of an unprecedented crisis which has left him vulnerable to the dangers that have spread beyond the bar.</p>

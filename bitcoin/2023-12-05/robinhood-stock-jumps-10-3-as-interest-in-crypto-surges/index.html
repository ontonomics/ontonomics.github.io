    <p>The US economy grew sharply in the last three months of the year, according to a report by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) agency, the Financial Times newspaper says, as higher interest rates remain lower than previously forecasted, but weakness in services businesses has continued to be seen as the worst growth in history.. () US stock markets have reported their lowest level since October, and analysts have warned that the economic recovery is expected to continue to grow. Why is it likely the Fed s move to cut Treasury yields could lead to the recession in 2024? The latest report shows that employment in US services and services sectors slowed for the fourth time since 2021, after reports suggested the rate of interest rate would be at the peak, with investors warning that it will be cut in next year. But what does it mean for US business workers and consumers, in particular for services companies, has been slumped during the month of November, it has seen another fall in sales and investment. The stock market plunged to its highest level in more than two years, despite expectations that US government inflation is at its peak - and it is not going to see signs of further increases in economic activity, writes The Wall Street Journal. A preliminary report has shown that interests are falling significantly, thanks to an annual rise in jobs. Here is the full assessment of how they are struggling.</p>

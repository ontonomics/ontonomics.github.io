  <meta name="description" content="India is not expected to introduce laws for cryptocurrencies or Web3 in the near future, according to Jayant Sinha, Chair of the Standing Committee on Finance in India&rsquo;s Parliament. Sinha believes that regulators and policymakers need to find a balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring safety, which will happen over the next 12 to 18 months. India already has rules against money laundering and a tax structure for crypto, and aims to align with global standards by the end of 2025. Sinha emphasized that cryptocurrencies are just one use case for the revolutionary technologies behind Web3.

Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, has withdrawn its application for certain operations in Abu Dhabi.

Bitcoin&rsquo;s recent surge in popularity has led to increased interest in buying cryptocurrency with Apple Pay.

JPMorgan uses blockchain for its stablecoin, JPM Coin, which is tied to the U.S. dollar and used for client payments. However, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon opposes cryptocurrencies, stating that their only real use is for criminal activities like money laundering and tax evasion. He suggests that governments should shut down the industry. Dimon made these comments in response to a question from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who wants more regulations on cryptocurrencies.
Binance&rsquo;s unit in Abu Dhabi has withdrawn its application with the Emirate&rsquo;s financial regulator, but it is unrelated to the company&rsquo;s settlement with US authorities. The application, which would have allowed Binance to manage a collective investment fund, was withdrawn after assessing its global licensing needs. Binance&rsquo;s spokesperson says the decision is not connected to the $4.3 billion settlement, and the exchange plans to keep working with regulators in other countries, including Dubai. Binance Limited still has permission to provide financial services related to crypto custody in the Abu Dhabi Global Market.
Bitcoin miners have sold off 3,000 BTC, worth $131 million, in the past day, according to on-chain data. This has significantly reduced the BTC miner reserve.
Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. has reported increased mining revenue. In November 2023, the company mined 193 Bitcoin and generated around $0.7 million in energy revenue. This is a 4% increase compared to the previous month. Stronghold also had its highest monthly revenue in 2023, totaling $7.2 million. The company attributes this success to favorable power prices, improved Bitcoin hash price, and increased mining utilization. Stronghold will also host a Business Strategy Overview and Carbon Capture Panel event on December 12th, which will discuss the company&rsquo;s carbon capture initiative.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has expressed concerns about cryptocurrency, stating that it poses a new threat to the world. She highlighted the use of crypto by criminals and terrorists globally.
The Bank of England&rsquo;s financial stability report highlights the growing interest in asset tokenization in the financial sector. It emphasizes the need for global regulatory coordination and mentions banks&#39; increasing positivity towards using crypto technologies like programmable ledgers and smart contracts. This suggests a potential shift towards embracing blockchain-based solutions in the industry.
Ripple&rsquo;s native token, XRP, has seen an 88% increase in value since the beginning of the year, currently trading at around $0.64. While it hasn&rsquo;t experienced as dramatic a surge as other digital currencies like Bitcoin, XRP has been steadily progressing in the market. Analysts believe that XRP may have further growth potential.

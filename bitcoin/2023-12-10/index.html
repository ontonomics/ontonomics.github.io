  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin Goes Up, Attracts Regular People
Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency, has gone up in price. It&rsquo;s now between $43,000 and $46,000. This is a big increase from last December, and regular people are interested in it.
A few things have made the price go up. Some people think the Federal Reserve might lower rates in March 2024. This makes people hopeful that Bitcoin will be worth more. Also, big financial companies like BlackRock and Fidelity want to make Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This has made people excited. If these ETFs get approved, they would be the first of their kind and could get more regular people to invest.
But not everyone thinks Bitcoin is a good long-term investment. The CEO of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, doesn&rsquo;t trust cryptocurrencies. He thinks they might not be real or stable.
Even though some people don&rsquo;t trust Bitcoin, a lot of regular people are interested in it. If the price goes past $50,000, even more regular people might want to invest.

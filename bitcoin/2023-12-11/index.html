  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency News Digest: XRP, Token Burns, Injective Protocol, Pension Fund Investment, Digital Asset Inflows, and More
Today&rsquo;s cryptocurrency news brings you the latest updates on Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Here are the top stories:


Galaxy Digital CEO Optimistic about XRP
Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz is hopeful about XRP and Ripple. He believes that Ripple&rsquo;s recent court victories against the SEC show that XRP is strong. Novogratz praised Ripple&rsquo;s team and CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and recognized the passionate XRP community. He also mentioned the different uses of XRP, comparing it to Bitcoin as another way to store value. His positive outlook has sparked interest in the XRP community.


Token Burns Boost LUNC and Shiba Inu Prices
The LUNC and Shiba Inu communities have burned some of their tokens to reduce the total supply. The LUNC community burned over 85 billion tokens, which caused prices to rise. Binance has supported this burn initiative. On the other hand, the Shiba Inu community burned around 45% of the total token supply, but it didn&rsquo;t have a significant impact on the token&rsquo;s price.


Injective Protocol Sees Surge in Social Media Activity
Injective Protocol (INJ) has gained a lot of attention on social media, becoming the second-most mentioned token after Bitcoin. In the past 24 hours and week, there has been a significant increase in mentions, indicating growing interest. This rise in social media activity has coincided with rising prices for INJ, suggesting that its value may continue to grow. Injective Protocol is a decentralized exchange platform that offers faster and more scalable trading compared to traditional exchanges. With its unique features and partnerships, INJ could potentially reach new all-time highs above $25.


UK Pension Fund Invests in Cryptocurrency
M&amp;G plc&rsquo;s investment arm, based in London, has invested $20 million in Global Futures &amp; Options Holdings (GFO-X), becoming the first UK pension fund to invest in cryptocurrency. This move could potentially encourage other pension funds to do the same, although careful research and limited allocations to specific categories are expected.


Digital Asset Inflows Continue for 11th Consecutive Week
Investment products for digital assets have seen inflows for the 11th week in a row, totaling $43 million. However, the latest inflows were lower compared to previous weeks, as some investors took a cautious approach due to recent price increases. Bitcoin remains the main focus for investors, attracting $20 million in new inflows.


Wrapped Velas Trades Flat, Other Cryptocurrencies Experience Price Changes
Wrapped Velas (WVLX) had no significant changes in its trading price against the dollar in the last 24 hours, with a total market cap of $50.22 million. Other cryptocurrencies like KILT Protocol, Aidi Finance, Zoo Token, CareCoin, Kitty Inu, Hokkaidu Inu, Lego Coin, Jeff in Space, Lumi Credits, and AXIA Coin experienced various changes in their trading prices.


SBI Holdings and Saudi Aramco Explore Collaboration in Digital Asset Investment
Japanese financial services firm SBI Holdings and Saudi Arabian state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to explore collaboration in digital asset investment and semiconductor production projects. They plan to establish SBI Middle East in Riyadh as a base for operations in the region. The alliance may expand in the future.


Bitcoin Price Drops, But Bullish Outlook Remains
The price of Bitcoin has dropped, but many people still believe in its potential for the future.

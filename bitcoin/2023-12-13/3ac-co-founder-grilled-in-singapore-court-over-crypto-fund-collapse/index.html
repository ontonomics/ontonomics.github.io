    <p>The co-founder of one of the world s biggest crypto-currency companies, Su Zhu, has been questioned over the collapse of a huge cryptocurrency fund, Bloomberg has revealed, citing an investigation by the BBC. Why is the case going to be handled by financial giant Three Arrows Capital, and why is it possible to delay. But How is this really happening in the future of crypto markets? The chief executive of three arrows Capital has faced questioning over its failure to recover billions of US dollars from investors? They are being asked to answer questions about the risks surrounding the fund - and how they can recover from the bankruptcy which has led to the loss of more than $300bn (300m) worth of money? What is behind the decision to pay for the company? A court hearing heard in Singapore on Monday. The founder is facing questions over how he failed to find out how much money he has lost in their bank account? So what happened to his former chairman? And how does he get the money to buy shares in his own accounts? and what could happen if he is not able to survive when he was found guilty of failing to get another stake in this fund? Is it actually allowed to take steps towards saving money for those who believe it was damaged by fraudulent attacks on the business? How did the firm remain in liquidators stealing millions of dollar from creditors?</p>

    <p>US President Donald Trump is selling a limited edition of his suit he wore when he was arrested and booked in the US state of Georgia, according to the site promoted by the former president s website Truth Social. But what is it like to buy the suit and dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago - and what does it mean for you?. ()    The US president is to be able to sell it for $4.7m (4.5m) worth of NFTs, but it is not the most historical artifact in US history, and it has been claimed that it cannot be fulfilled by buying it, as it looks like it will be an extraordinary  dinner  with the man who was kept in jail for the first time. The site is promoting the new  Mugshot edition  of the Trump suit which appears to have gone on sale during his arrest in July 2023? Why is this one of those who buy their clothes while being held in custody without the bonus physical cards? What is the way it deals with US citizens and people who are willing to get it? The truth social website has revealed the possibility that they can buy it in order to avoid the  gas fee  because of an illegal shooting? It could be the only thing that makes it harder than you would have to pay for another piece of Trump spending thousands of miles of euros (almost $500,000) in an online auction of US assets?</p>

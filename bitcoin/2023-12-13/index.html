  <meta name="description" content="The cryptocurrency market has lost a lot of money recently, over $68 billion, because of different schemes and events. This shows how risky it is to invest in unregulated financial instruments. The market has also been affected by hacks and scams, which hurt investors. But not all exchanges have had the same problems, and the industry keeps changing.
One example of a digital asset exchange is Unizen (ZCX). In the past day, it has seen a 4.1% increase in trading against the US dollar. Unizen lets people access blockchain projects and combines the features of a secure CEX, DEX, AI-driven social sentiment indicators, and Binance-level liquidity. Other cryptocurrencies like KILT Protocol (KILT), Aidi Finance (BSC) (AIDI), and Zoo Token (ZOOT) have also seen changes in their trading prices.
Metal (MTL) has seen a 2.6% increase in trading against the dollar in the last day. Metal is used to pay for transaction fees and get rewards on the Metal Pay platform. Investors can get Metal by first buying Ethereum or Bitcoin with US dollars and then using those cryptocurrencies to buy Metal on exchanges like Changelly, Gemini, or GDAX.
Pirate Chain (ARRR) has seen a 1.7% increase in trading against the US dollar in one day. Pirate Chain wants to be the most private and secure digital currency. It uses a privacy protocol that hides 100% of peer-to-peer transactions. Other cryptocurrencies like Zcash, Bitcoin Gold, Horizen, Komodo, Bitcoin Private, and ZClassic have also been traded.
AvocadoCoin (AVDO) has seen a small increase in trading against the US dollar. One token is worth about $890.15. AvocadoCoin wants to create a system of new technologies for agriculture and become a global reference for organic and sustainable products.
Tellor (TRB) has had a big 13.5% increase in trading against the US dollar in the past day. Tellor is a decentralized oracle system that uses a token called &ldquo;Tributes&rdquo; (TRB) to reward miners and check data updates.
WaykiChain Governance Coin (WGRT) has seen a small increase in trading against the US dollar. It has a market cap of $99.58 million. WaykiChain Governance Coin is the governing coin for WaykiChain&rsquo;s decentralized lending platform.
Utrust (UTK) has seen a 0.8% increase in trading against the dollar in the past day. Utrust wants to make it easier for people to use digital currency by offering secure and affordable crypto transactions.
Waterfall Network has hired Jeff McDonald as Director of Community. Waterfall Network is a decentralized smart contract platform. McDonald has a lot of experience in the blockchain industry and will help build a strong community and get more people to use the platform.
TrueUSD (TUSD) is a stablecoin that is tied to the US dollar. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain. It gives people and businesses a digital alternative to USD that is stable and can be used for exchange.
Vertcoin (VTC) has had a 2.2% increase in trading against the US dollar in one day. Vertcoin wants to make sure that everyone can access it with just a personal computer.
Grin (GRIN) has had a 4.2% increase in trading against the US dollar in one day. Grin is a cryptocurrency that focuses on privacy. It uses the Mimblewimble protocol to make transactions more private, scalable, and fungible.
Counos X (CCXX) has had a 4.4% increase in trading against the US dollar in one day. Counos X is part of the Counos platform, which offers different financial services including cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and an escrow system.
The Graph (GRT) has seen a 4.8% increase in trading against the dollar in the past day. The Graph is a decentralized protocol that organizes and searches data from blockchains. This makes it easier for developers to build decentralized applications.
Even though the cryptocurrency market is risky and volatile, it still attracts investors and changes over time. These digital assets offer unique opportunities and challenges. It&rsquo;s important for investors to do thorough research and be careful when investing in this market.

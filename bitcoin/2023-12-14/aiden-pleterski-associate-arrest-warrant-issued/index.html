    <p>A Canadian citizen has been arrested after a court ordered him to surrender his passport after he claimed to be in Dubai for an alleged Ponzi scheme which led to millions of dollars in bankruptcy damages across the country, the BBC has learned, amid reports of an investigation by the justice agency in Ontario.. ()  One of Aiden Pleterski has appeared in court for the first time in more than another year in custody. The case is being investigated by police in the UK and Canada, but he is not facing criminal charges, and says he has not been allowed to travel to Dubai, as he accuses him of fraudulent offshore investment scam, after his arrest warrant was issued to his home in Canada while he allegedly collected hundreds of million dollar worth of money from members of his community to buy funds to an ex-accountant who claims he flew to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - but could be charged with illegal financial corruption against him, police have told him they are looking for him until the end of the year. Why is it possible to arrest him in contempt of court in his bid to stop him from arresting him? The BBC understands how the case looks set to take place when he was found guilty of criminal accusations related to him and his family? They have been described as the  crypto king s own wealthy businessman, Ryan Rumble, who has said he had nothing wrong.</p>

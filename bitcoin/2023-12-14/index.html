  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin News Digest: Ethereum&rsquo;s Upcoming Upgrade, Family Offices Investing in Blockchain, and Changes in the Crypto Industry
Introduction:
In today&rsquo;s Bitcoin news, we will give you the latest updates on cryptocurrency. We want to help you understand Bitcoin, its risks, and how to spot false sustainability claims. We will also talk about strategies used by companies in the Bitcoin industry and show recent examples. We will also explain why consumers should be aware of these practices and talk about how public opinion can affect Bitcoin. Let&rsquo;s get started!
Ethereum&rsquo;s Network Upgrade to Boost Activity:
JPMorgan thinks Ethereum will do better than Bitcoin next year because of its network upgrade called &ldquo;Protodanksharding.&rdquo; This upgrade is expected to make Ethereum&rsquo;s network more active after a period of low activity. It could make Ethereum one of the top cryptocurrencies.
Family Offices Investing More in Blockchain:
A report by Grant Thornton shows that 35% of family offices plan to invest more in blockchain technology. 27% also plan to invest more in cryptocurrencies. The report also says that over half of family offices have already invested in virtual assets. This shows that blockchain and cryptocurrencies are becoming more important in alternative investments.
Changes in the Crypto Industry:
The crypto industry is going through changes as influential leaders like Changpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman-Fried face legal troubles. This creates an opportunity for new executives like Paolo Ardoino and Richard Teng to emerge. Coinbase&rsquo;s CEO, Brian Armstrong, is seen as the last important person in the industry. His company could benefit if a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is approved.
Other Important News:
LUKSO (LYXe), a blockchain for digital lifestyle, has seen changes in trading against the US dollar. ZEON (ZEON) continues to offer decentralized financial and insurance services. CoinDesk, a leading news platform on cryptocurrency, has updated its privacy policy and terms of use after being acquired by Bullish group, the owner of Bullish, a regulated digital assets exchange.
Conclusion:
As the crypto industry changes, it&rsquo;s important for consumers to know what&rsquo;s happening. Understanding the strategies used by companies in the Bitcoin industry and being able to spot false sustainability claims is important. Public opinion can make or break Bitcoin&rsquo;s success and its impact on people and the environment. Staying informed about industry practices and their effects is key to making smart decisions in this fast-changing world.

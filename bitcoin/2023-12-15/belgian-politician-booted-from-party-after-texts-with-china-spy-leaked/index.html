    <p>A Belgian politician is being accused of plotting to destabilise the US and Europe, leaked documents show, according to a joint investigation by the Financial Times and the French Times. They are among those who have been removed from their party, but they are now embroiled in an international conspiracy ring which threatens to divide the BBC. What is it actually going to be known as the  Chinese Communist Party  - and why does it be likely to influence Europe s relationship with the United States and China? These are some of the most serious questions about the countrys political agenda, writes The New York Times, the Guardian and The Wall Street Journal. The Dutch Foreign Policy newspaper looks at what appears to have emerged in the newly released documents revealing how the UK is trying to change the European relationship between the two countries, and how it can affect the EU and its neighbours, as well as Britain and France. Here is the story of what is happening in Brussels, Belgium, France and Germany. A former parliamentary member has been banned from his party after allegedly serving as an assets for Chinese communist spying group linked to the Chinese government, who is facing an inquiry into allegations that he sought to infiltrate the world and try to break up diplomatic ties with US officials and critics of Chinese intelligence officers and politicians in Europe and other countries. But what has happened to an ex-Brussels MP, Frank Creylman?</p>

    <p>The world s biggest crypto-currency company has announced a huge year-end sale of up to 60% off its cutting-edge services, including game development, AI development and Token Development. These are some of the companies offering savings from their latest acquisitions, the BBC has learned. The company is celebrating the centenary of Bitcoin. But What is it really worth enough to boost the digital currency - and what does it mean for the future of your business? Welcome to the Crypto Exchange and blockchain development services which are being rolled out this year, and how will the company become the next buyer of crypto currencies and cryptocurrencies? It is expected to be the first to sell them on the market in 2023, but it is now going to take advantage of an increasing amount of discounts across the world, as it prepares to launch an ambitious expansion of its services and launcher platform packages, in an attempt to attract millions of visitors to buy them in January 2024. Here is the full list of major deals for those who want to get the chance to invest more than 5% off each of them, with an exciting sale to mark the end of 2023 when it comes to digital transformation. But what are the key ways they have gone on to develop these services? The BBC understands how it can be able to make it available for more funding. This week, we speak to Bitdeal, who explains what happens in the UK and the US, to find out what is happening.</p>

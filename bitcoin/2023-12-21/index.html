  <meta name="title" content="Marathon Digital Sees Massive Growth in Bitcoin Mining, Plans to Expand Mining Power"/>
  <meta name="description" content="Marathon Digital, a top Bitcoin mining company, had a huge increase of 622.8% in 2023. This happened because they got more mining sites, which let them mine more Bitcoin and spend less on electricity. They want to add 390 megawatts to their mining power, using money they already have. People who study the market think this is good for Marathon and will help them do even better in the crypto industry. Bitcoin fees for transactions are also very high right now, so Marathon is making a lot of money from mining. In the third quarter, their income got much bigger, more than seven times bigger. In the future, Marathon wants to mine 30% more Bitcoin in 2024.
Argentina&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Minister, Diana Mondino, said Bitcoin will be a legal currency for contracts in the country. This is because the value of Argentina&rsquo;s money is going down, and the government wants to find new ways to make the economy stable.
In Ethereum, people used to say it was going to fail, but now they are changing their minds. This is a good sign, according to an Ethereum teacher named Sassal. They think it is a good time to buy more Ethereum before its price goes up.

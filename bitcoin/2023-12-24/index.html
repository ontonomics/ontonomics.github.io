Apart from the changes in the cryptocurrency market, David Collum&rsquo;s &ldquo;Year in Review&rdquo; talks about different problems like healthcare, investing, broken markets, and law and order. Collum is worried about the law and order in the United States. He talks about the opioid epidemic, open borders, and how the justice system is being used for politics.
Overall, the value of cryptocurrencies keeps going up and down. This gives investors both chances and challenges. As the market changes, it&rsquo;s important for investors to stay informed and make smart choices.

    <p>The Democratic Party s congresswoman Linda Sanchez is raising money for the first time in a growing campaign to support Latino voters in the US Congress. But what does it mean for those who want to be elected to Congress and their political rivals? They are talking about the fight for Latino votes in an election where abortion could be part of. ()   Why is it really important to get more of them in Congress? And why are they coming to the polls?  says she tells the story of her efforts to raise money to help elect Latinos and Latin Americans to win elections across the United States? It is one of the biggest campaigns in Latin America, which has been launched by the Republicans, who have been leading the campaign against the Trump administration and the White House - and what is the main cause of violence between the two parties? What would it be like for them to take back the House of Commons? The campaign has taken place in Los Angeles, California and Arizona. When it comes into politics, she is trying to find out what it is likely to lead to an increasing number of candidates to run for Congress, and how it can be done to make it harder for women to campaign for Latin voting in US states such as Alabama, Arizona and California, but while senators are still struggling to vote for more than half of Congress nominees, her campaign is not always going to happen. The BBC looks at what happens.</p>

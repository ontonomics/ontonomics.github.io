  <meta name="description" content="BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, has updated its application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company has chosen Jane Street Capital and JP Morgan Securities as authorized participants for the ETF. This is important because JP Morgan, a bank that has been skeptical of cryptocurrencies in the past, is now involved, which has surprised industry experts.
In another news, the Avalanche Foundation has announced that it will include meme coins in its Culture Catalyst program. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that started from internet memes and viral trends. The program aims to support creators, drive innovation, and promote the use of blockchain technology. Meme coins are not just digital assets, but also represent online communities connected through humor and shared culture.
Cardano (ADA), a popular cryptocurrency, recently reached a new highest price of $0.66 for the year. However, it has since gone down by 7% in daily charts and 3% in the last 14 days. Despite these short-term changes, ADA remains positive in monthly charts, with a 58% increase in the previous 30 days. Since the start of the year, ADA&rsquo;s price has gone up by almost 150%.
US Congressman Tom Emmer, also known as the &ldquo;Crypto King&rdquo; of Congress, has introduced the SEC Stabilization Act. The act aims to remove SEC Chairman Gary Gensler from his position. Emmer is worried about Gensler&rsquo;s regulations in the cryptocurrency industry, which he believes are stopping innovation and hindering the growth of the sector.
Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin recently talked about the future of blockchain in a blog post. While the usage of the Ethereum network has remained high, its price has gone down. Unlike other altcoins, Ethereum&rsquo;s price hasn&rsquo;t seen significant growth lately. However, Buterin is still working on the project and there have been developments on the network.
In the world of altcoins, Trexcoin (TREX) and Dejitaru Tsuka (TSUKA) have seen trading activity in the past week. Trexcoin&rsquo;s trading has been steady against the dollar, while Dejitaru Tsuka&rsquo;s trading has increased by 6.7% against the US dollar in the past 24 hours. Both tokens can be acquired by first buying Ethereum or Bitcoin and then using one of the mentioned exchanges.
Crypto International (CRI) and Maiar DEX (MEX) are also experiencing trading activity. Crypto International&rsquo;s trading has been steady against the US dollar, while Maiar DEX&rsquo;s trading has increased by 2.4% against the dollar in a one-day period. Both tokens can be bought on major exchanges by first acquiring Bitcoin or Ethereum.
Overall, the cryptocurrency market is always changing. As more institutions and individuals start using cryptocurrencies, the industry is likely to grow and innovate. However, it&rsquo;s important for investors to stay informed and be cautious when dealing with this volatile market.

    <p>US prosecutors have rejected a request to bring further charges against the founder of the FTX, saying they would not be able to carry evidence at their second trial in 2024, if he is convicted of another cryptocurrency fraud case, which could be delayed until the end of next year s sentencing.. () But  The US jury has said it is not necessary for the conviction of an extradition from the Bahamas to the United States, it has been confirmed by the US state judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, who says the case is  not essential  and does not have to be considered in the trial of one of his former chief financial officer, Sam Bankman-Fried, has told the New York court that he will remain in jail for defrauding customers of $10 billion (7.7bn) worth of money, fraud and bribery, as part of its investigation into his convictions is expected to take place next month. The FBI has warned that it will not allow him to stand trial within the next two weeks, after his trial was temporarily dropped, but it looks set to change the way he appears in his case when he sentences him in November, and he may face decades of inprisonment because he has not been allowed to give up proof of fraud, bankruptcy and bank fraud. Why is it likely to have been denied being involved in an illegal currency fraud trial, the court has ruled.</p>

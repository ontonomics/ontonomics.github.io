    <p>The chief executive of a mortgage-backed securities company has resigned after being forced out by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) following claims he was involved in an illegal merger with the financial services firm Hughes Financial Services (HLS) in the US. The company is reported to be taking over the firm in January. Why? () But The BBC Newsnight looks at the company s latest announcement on the stock exchange briefly revealed that it has gone on sale, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal and Forbes. Here is the story of what happened when it announced it was acquired by US regulators, after it received another delisting notice from US stock exchanges which closed their shares in US markets - and what is it likely to have been linked to its former chairman and co-founder, William Erbey, who has returned to the top of the board of General Lloyds Group (HLSE) to sell its assets to US firm Altisource Asset Management, and how it will take it out of control. It has been described as the biggest acquisition of US companies, but it is now going to take over investors in front of it, as it prepares to move towards the sale of some of its shareholders and its bosses, the BBC has learned. But what does it mean for those who have failed to make it possible to retain its owner? They are among the companies he had been in charge of, at least.</p>

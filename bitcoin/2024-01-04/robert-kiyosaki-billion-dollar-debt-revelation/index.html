    <p>A controversial admission of a $1 billion in debt has sparked controversy over his financial strategy. The BBC s Christine Blasey looks at what it means to be the latest celebrity to reveal that he has accumulated more than $1bn (1.6tn) worth of cash in bankruptcy, and how he doesnt.  What is the difference between the two types of money? Jamie Bartlett explains what he thinks about his personal finances and why he is so wealthy, writes the BBCs Victoria Derbyshire, who has been talking to him on social media for the first time since he was found guilty of admitting that millions of people are struggling to get their fortunes, including those who claimed that they are not his own, as well as how his approach to personal banking is often associated with his unconventional views on corporate finance, but what makes it harder for him to think about the way he deals with the money he spends on to develop - and what is it like to make him become the most successful businessman in the world of self-made businesses and business ventures. Why is this one of the biggest challenges in his career? The findings of his unique view on personal money and the impact on his economic attitude to the business is not always going to have reached the point of doing it to help him achieve growth? What really happens to his business? And how might he be able to do so?</p>

    <p>A Twitter account has been hacked by an unknown party after a post shared false information about the agencys approved Bitcoin exchange-traded products. Another post has become the first such account to be deleted by the US Treasury and Financial Crimes Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, which went ahead with an unprecedented delay to determine. () The FBI says it is being investigated for further investigations into the alleged hacking of an account on the social media platform, Twitter, and other financial services firms, as well as those involved in the cyber-attack against crypto-currency currency, Bitcoin shares and stock market markets - including cryptocurrency exchanges, but it remains under scrutiny. The US regulator has confirmed that the account had been compromised because it was linked to an  unauthorised  attack on one of its Twitter accounts, after an online post that claimed it had not been allowed to sell and trading of spot bitcoin funds on all registered national securities  Exchanges (NYSE) investments in US stocks and crypto currencies, in order to protect investors from illegal attacks on their platforms in recent days, with more than 50,000 requests for information from hackers. But what happened to the company s account when it emerged of the hack, is not expected to have been removed from its account, writes The New York Times newspaper. A massive leak of information has led to speculation that it has had nothing to do so.</p>

  <meta name="description" content="US Senator Elizabeth Warren is worried about the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) approval of Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. She thinks more enforcement is needed to make sure cryptocurrencies are integrated properly into everyday finance. This criticism comes at a time when the altcoin market is growing a lot, with assets like Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) going up in value by double digits. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has led to a rally in different assets.
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently suggested increasing the network&rsquo;s block gas limit by 33% in a Reddit AMA session. This change is meant to make Ethereum better and improve its smart contract abilities.
In the US, a truck driver turned a $650 investment in SHIB token into $1.7 million in just nine months. This shows how unpredictable and life-changing investing in digital currencies can be. However, the SHIB market has cooled down a lot, with prices now 85% lower than their highest point. This means it&rsquo;s less likely for current investors to make similar big profits.
Ethereum Classic (ETC) has gone up in value by 34% in the past 24 hours, doing better than other major cryptocurrencies. But the market sentiment is still neutral.
Finra&rsquo;s latest report card on compliance shows the difficulties that brokerage firms face when dealing with cryptocurrencies. This is the first time the report talks about this topic in detail, along with other compliance issues.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon thinks Bitcoin is &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; and a tool for criminals. He thinks digital assets should be banned. Recent scandals in the crypto industry have made US lawmakers look at it more closely.
Even though Elon Musk is trying to stop spam and bots on Twitter, scammers keep posting crypto scam ads on the platform.
A crypto analyst predicts that Ripple&rsquo;s XRP will reach $5 in the next 90 days, which is a big increase from its current value.
South Korea still doesn&rsquo;t like cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), even though the SEC recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.
While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has made the cryptocurrency market exciting, with altcoins like Cardano (ADA) going up a lot, the price of Bitcoin itself hasn&rsquo;t gone up much.
GMX (GMX) and other cryptocurrencies like KILT Protocol (KILT), Aidi Finance (BSC) (AIDI), and Zoo Token (ZOOT) have had changes in their trading values.
Bitcoin ETFs had a really successful first day of trading, with over $4 billion coming in.
Right now, the cryptocurrency market is growing in value and activity, with different assets going up a lot. But it&rsquo;s important for investors to stay informed and be careful in this fast-changing market.

  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin ETF Fee War: Franklin Templeton Takes the Lead
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light to Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), which has sparked a competition among providers to offer the lowest fees. Franklin Resources and its subsidiary, Franklin Templeton, are leading the way with a fee of only 0.19% for their Franklin Bitcoin ETF. This fee is lower than what their competitors are charging, which ranges from 0.2% to 1.5%.
To attract investors, Franklin is running a special promotion where they are offering a 0% fee for the first $10 billion of assets under management. This move has already caught attention, as Franklin&rsquo;s Bitcoin ETF ranked sixth out of a total of 11 Bitcoin ETFs on its first day of trading in terms of trading volume.
First Bitcoin ETFs Begin Trading Amidst Chaos
The first Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have started trading on Wall Street, with over $3.5 billion worth of shares traded by mid-day. However, the approval process for these ETFs was not smooth, as rumors, fake messages, and a brief statement on the SEC webpage caused confusion.
While some investors are excited about this milestone for cryptocurrencies, there are concerns about the ETF industry as a whole. Experts have expressed worries about wide bid/ask spreads and potential market manipulation. As a result, one report suggests investing in fundamentally superior stocks instead of taking the risk with Bitcoin ETFs.
Bitcoin Price Drops, but Rebound Expected
The recent drop in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led to a massive $100 billion loss in the crypto market. This decline followed a surge in the bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Well-known bitcoin trader Arthur Hayes had previously warned of a potential 30% crash in the bitcoin price due to actions by the Federal Reserve.
Despite this setback, Hayes believes that bitcoin will bounce back quickly because it is a global, non-liability currency. The recent crash is attributed to the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s response to rising inflation. However, the bitcoin price has since recovered, especially with the anticipation of the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.
Bitcoin ETF Trading Now Available on Multiple Platforms
Several stock-trading platforms, including Robinhood, Webull, Acorns, SoFi, and Interactive Brokers, have made it possible for customers to trade exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the spot price of bitcoin. Even traditional platforms like Fidelity, Schwab, E-Trade, and UBS have joined in and allowed bitcoin ETF trading.
However, Vanguard has chosen not to offer bitcoin ETFs, stating that they do not align with their focus on traditional asset classes. The value of bitcoin and bitcoin ETFs has come under scrutiny following the SEC&rsquo;s approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. It is important to note that SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized that the approval does not endorse bitcoin as an investment.
In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is going through significant changes with the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The competition among providers to offer lower fees, the chaotic start of trading, the drop in bitcoin price, and the availability of bitcoin ETF trading on different platforms are all things to keep an eye on. As the market continues to develop, it is crucial for investors to stay informed and make decisions based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.

    <p>Google has banned some of the worlds biggest crypto exchanges, including Binance and Kraken, from its Play Store in India and South Asian markets, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has said, after a massive crackdown on crypto-exchanges in the South Asia market was announced on Saturday. However, what does this mean for the internet market?. But  What is it really happened to the digital market and how could it be able to become the most successful online marketplace of internet users, and what is going to happen for those who are being allowed to use their accounts in which they operate illegally, has been revealed by the US government in an effort to stop them from operating on the platforms of Google and Apple? The BBC s Geeta Pandey has told the BBC about the impact of this latest blocking of these attacks? Why is the Google ban on some cryptoexchanges - and why is that threatening another huge blow to internet growth? And how can it make it take to take advantage of its efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and whether it is possible to get behind the cyber-attack on millions of people across the global market, asks the UK government to ask us to find out what happens to Google. The chief executive of India has warned that the country is in danger of becoming the second largest cryptocurrency market in Asia and Asia? BBC News looks at how the company is preparing to launch its new investigation into the risks.</p>

  <meta name="description" content="Google recently decided to remove certain cryptocurrency exchanges, like Binance and Kraken, from its Play Store in India. This has raised concerns about India&rsquo;s web3 ambitions. India has a big internet market, so this ban is a setback for the cryptocurrency industry there. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) played a role in this decision because these exchanges were flagged for operating illegally in the South Asian market. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see how this ban affects the cryptocurrency industry in India.
Binance and Coinbase are important players in the cryptocurrency exchange industry. Together, they make up 11.85% of the $1.68 trillion digital currency market. They also control 7.83% of the total bitcoin supply, which shows their significant influence on the market.
BitcoinBR (BTCBR) decreased in value by 4.9% against the US dollar in 24 hours. Other cryptocurrencies like KILT Protocol, Aidi Finance, Zoo Token, CareCoin, Kitty Inu, Hokkaidu Inu, Lego Coin, Jeff in Space, Lumi Credits, and AXIA Coin also saw changes in their values. BitcoinBR is a payment network that uses stablecoins and BTCBR for programmable payments and financial infrastructure development.
BitTorrent-New (BTT) had a small increase in trading against the US dollar, with a market cap of $1.04 billion. Other related cryptocurrencies like TRON and Tezos also had positive trading activity. BitTorrent-New is a token that works on the TRC-10 hashing algorithm.
Round Dollar (RD) had no changes in value against the dollar in the past 24 hours, and it has stayed the same over the last week. Similar cryptocurrencies like KILT Protocol, Aidi Finance, Zoo Token, CareCoin, Kitty Inu, Hokkaidu Inu, Lego Coin, Jeff in Space, Lumi Credits, and AXIA Coin also had different trading movements.
Conflux (CFX) increased in trading by 3.6% against the dollar in the past 24 hours. Other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin also had slight changes in their trading prices. Conflux is a coin that uses the Octopus hashing algorithm and was launched in October 2020.
Gary Gensler, Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said that the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) doesn&rsquo;t affect the potential approval of other cryptocurrency financial products. This statement comes after a court decision that approved Bitcoin ETFs.
dForce USD (USX) increased in value against the US dollar in the past day, but it decreased by 1.2% over the last week. Other related cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Uniswap also saw changes in their values. dForce USD is a token that uses the Scrypt hashing algorithm and works on the Ethereum platform.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to have price changes, showing how volatile the market is. It&rsquo;s important for consumers to know about these changes and the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. People&rsquo;s opinions about cryptocurrencies can be influenced by these price changes and the actions of important players in the industry. Case studies and examples can show how opinions are formed and the impact they can have on the market.

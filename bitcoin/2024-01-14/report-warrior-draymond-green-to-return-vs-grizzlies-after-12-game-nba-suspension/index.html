    <p>The basketball legend who was reinstated from his indefinite suspension of the season has appeared in a court in Los Angeles, according to the latest announcement by the US Basketball Association (NBA) in the wake of his decision to stop him from being suspended for 12 games in November. However, he is expected to take the court for the first time in six years. But Here, The BBC s Adam pantozzi looks at how he will return to his resume after he was thrown away from the NBA while playing against the Phoenix Suns in New York, and why he has not been allowed to leave the club, as he continues to be treated for another row over his injuries, in his first appearance since the end of this year, but he remains at the centre of an investigation into his role in an in-season tournament match with the Floyd Mayweather, who has been convicted of causing serious injury and caused further damages during the fight between him and his rival - and is to face an appeal for his re-election in May, on the second time since his retirement because he had been forced to go back to play their first game in five years when he returned to an NBA court on Monday. Here is the full transcript of what could be the story of him coming back, the BBC has learned, with reports from US and US players looking for him to get talks with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, saying he cannot afford to win matches. The NBA has confirmed that the player is returning.</p>

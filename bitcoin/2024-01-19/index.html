  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency News Update: Whales Increase Holdings, Fraud Charges, and Market Fluctuations
In today&rsquo;s news update, we will give you the latest information on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. We will cover fraud charges against a German businessman, whales taking advantage of market downturns, and recent market changes.
Fraud Charges Against German Businessman:
A German businessman named Horst Jicha has been charged with defrauding investors of over $150 million in a cryptocurrency scheme. Jicha and two others allegedly tricked investors with a marketing scheme. They said their company, USI Tech, was a crypto mining and trading platform for regular investors, but it was actually a scam.
Whales Increase Holdings During Market Downturn:
Bitcoin and Ethereum whales have been taking advantage of the recent market downturn by increasing their holdings. These big cryptocurrency holders have taken out a lot of Bitcoin from new wallets, showing that they believe in the long-term value of these digital assets.
Golem (GLM) and Safe (SAFE) Experience Market Fluctuations:
Golem, a digital currency used on the Golem Network, has slightly decreased in value against the US dollar in the past week. Safe, a PoW/PoS coin, has also gone down in value against the US dollar in the last 24 hours. These changes show that the cryptocurrency market can be very unstable.
DigiByte (DGB) Introduces DigiAssets:
DigiByte, a blockchain platform, has introduced DigiAssets. This platform lets people create digital assets, decentralized applications (DApps), and smart contracts. DigiByte is different from Bitcoin because it offers better security, speed, and capacity. If you want to get DigiByte, you can buy Bitcoin or Ethereum and use an exchange to convert it.
Energi (NRG) and Ark (ARK) Experience Value Fluctuations:
Energi, a self-sufficient cryptocurrency with its own Treasury and Governance system, has gone down in value against the US dollar in the past 24 hours. Ark, a distributed proof-of-stake (dPOS) coin, has slightly gone up in value against the dollar. These changes show that the cryptocurrency market is always changing.
Bend DAO (BEND) and SALT (SALT) Witness Trading Fluctuations:
Bend DAO, a decentralized NFT liquidity protocol, has gone down in value against the US dollar in the last 24 hours. SALT, a cryptocurrency on the Ethereum platform, has gone up in value against the dollar. These changes show that the cryptocurrency market can be very unpredictable.
PotCoin (POT) and Bitcoin ETF Launch Impact Bitcoin Price:
PotCoin, a coin for the marijuana industry, has gone down in value against the US dollar. The launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on January 12 has contributed to the decrease in Bitcoin&rsquo;s price. The selling pressure and outflows from Grayscale&rsquo;s Bitcoin Trust ETF have affected the market.
Binance Supports AltLayer (ALT) on Launchpool:
Binance, a global cryptocurrency exchange, is supporting AltLayer (ALT) on its Launchpool platform. AltLayer is a protocol for Ethereum rollups, which process transactions off the Ethereum blockchain. This collaboration is the 45th project supported by Binance Launchpool.
Bitcoin ETFs Provide Convenient Investment Options:
Several new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have started trading recently, making it easier for everyday investors to invest in cryptocurrency. These ETFs track the price of Bitcoin and let investors buy shares like they would buy stock in a company. However, financial planners warn that cryptocurrency investments have risks and are not regulated like traditional ETFs.
Conclusion:
As the cryptocurrency market changes, it&rsquo;s important to stay informed. From fraud charges to market changes and new investment options, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency offer both opportunities and risks. Investors should be careful and seek advice from financial professionals before making any decisions.

    <p> I m chasing a ghost,  says James.  It s not going to be likely to become the first basketball player to win the US Open. I ve just been talking about him - and I wouldn t be able to do it again  according to the former NBA captain, Jesse D. Garrabrant. But why is this really certain? Why is it so often referred to as  the GOAT  and what does it mean for him to play against Curry, Pierce and LeBron James, which has never played in Cleveland Cavaliers since 2003 and when he was knocked out of the finals of his third title in the NBA, and is being called the  ghost  of Kobe Bryant, who is the most successful player of all time, as he appears to have nothing to say about their ability to score while taking part in an exclusive debate about the future of Michael Jordan and his career? And is there another player that cannot be dismissed by the GOTA, the BBC has learned, but it is hard to find out that he is not the only player who has ever taken the top spot on the ground? The BBC looks at how James makes it harder to compare him with Kevin Anderson? What is that behind the controversy between the two players, in particular, that they re very consistently making it easier for me to get the chance to take advantage of him? Is it possible to stop him from playing in his first game?</p>

    <p>The Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary have been named as the Democratic presidential candidate for the US presidency, according to a preliminary poll of Republican voters. Here s what happened to Donald Trump and Nikki Haley in the race to win the White House - and what is happening to his political rival, and who is the BBC. () What is going to be known to the polls and how is it likely to have their votes counted in these weeks. Why are the results of the election coming to an end and why are those who have won the battle to qualify for US President-elect Joe Biden? What happens? And who will be the frontrunner in this race? The latest morning consult poll has been conducted between the two states ahead of this election? Here are some of them being revealed by electoral campaigners who voted to select the candidates to run for another US president? Where are we among the most significant winners in an election season? How will they win? and whether it is possible to get the right to take part in election campaigns across the country? This is what looks like, but what will happen to US elections when it comes to election in 2020? It is an opportunity to find out who has secured this nomination earlier this year. What does it happen? A third remains on the top of one of its highest numbers and will become the next nominee? Is it possible?</p>

    <p>US rapper 50 Cent is suing a radio host who claimed he struck her in the face, according to reports from the US media, TMZ and NBC News. They are among the victims of an alleged faulty microphone thrown off stage during one of his tour dates, but they are still being investigated by the BBC. () How is the singer behind the controversy has been cleared of claims that she was involved in an incident where he tossed an acoustic loudspeaker in his concert shows, and is facing legal charges against the Rapper for the first time since he was hit by an audio host which says it was causing her serious injuries. The BBC has released images of the incident. Here is what appears to be known as the  Get Rich or Die Tryin  - and what happened to the music industry when it went viral in Los Angeles, California, in what is reportedly the biggest hit of hip-hop history, as it emerges from an interview with Curtis Mackay, who is accused that 50 cent was injured in their latest appearance on the show. What is it likely to have gone wrong? Why is this really going to happen? A legal case is under way for another row over the accusation of one complaint between the two parties. A judge has heard that the rap could be prosecuted for more than two decades of legal action, writes The New York Times.</p>

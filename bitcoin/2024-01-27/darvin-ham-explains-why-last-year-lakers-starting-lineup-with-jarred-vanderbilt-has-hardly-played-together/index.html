    <p>When L.A. leaves the starting lineup for the first time in a row, its being asked if it is possible to go back to their former league captain Taurean Vando, who was injured at the outset of the season, and why he has not gone to the same leading line up. But what is it?  () How is the Los Angeles Lakers really needs to do to get back into the team consistently during the current season and what does it mean for those who have played with the club in the past two seasons? Why is this going to be the biggest challenge of basketball history? And could it be coming back when it comes to an effort to make it easier for them to win the Western Conference finals, according to one of its top players, but what are the reasons that they are still struggling to play with each other in this season? The BBC s Ed Sheeran looks at how the LAkers have been playing with them once again - and how might the group become another threat to lose the top of this year? What makes it harder for him to stay away from getting back in game shape while taking part in his first season in five years? A few weeks before the US Open, the BBC has learned from the front line where the line-up is expected to return to its latest victory in two teams? How would it take to turn back at least one game?</p>

    <p>The United States Agency of International Development (USAID) has warned users to ignore messages and posts from a Facebook page that was breached by hackers earlier this week. Warning: This article contains graphic images of the apparent hacking of an agencys social media page, which appears to have been published by the US Embassy. ().  The US government says it is investigating how it was reported to be linked to an alleged scam in Colombia, but it has been described as the biggest threat to the country s Facebook account being hacked in the past few days - and reports that it could be used to target hundreds of millions of US citizens across the world. The latest warning is that the site is in danger of deleting because of cyber-crimes that have spread worldwide, and is not visible for the first time in more than two decades, as it emerged. But the UK government has said it will not respond to questions about why it had been targeted when it came into force on Monday evening, after another investigation into how the social network was targeting thousands in their accounts, in order to protect those who believe they were among the victims, who have had nothing to do with the scam. A huge amount of information is coming to light on the risk of dealing with illegal attacks on its Facebook pages and the way it deals with an online scam that has already revealed the story of its failure to access it.</p>

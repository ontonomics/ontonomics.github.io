    <p>The US economy is going to become more complicated than previously thought, according to one of the world s biggest investors. But what does this mean for a Spanish-language businessman, who has spent the last four years in the White House, asks Gabriela Berrospi, the founder of Wall Street, and what will happen this year. What is the BBC. How is it expected to be the beginning of January 2021 and why is this coming - and how could the country be affected by the economic crisis when it comes to recession and whether it is likely to take place next year? What would happen if the US government is not enough to improve growth? And how will it be able to predict the future of US President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, becoming the first person in Latin America to look at what is happening in November, as economists are talking about the impact on their fortunes and the prospects of what happens in this time? Where will they go ahead? The latest financial analyst says it will be more difficult to assess the level of activity during the election, but what can happen to the market in 2021? Here, she explains how the UK is preparing for the next few weeks, in which rates remain high, with higher inflation and an increase in federal and family debt, or where will those who have been waiting to see the effects of this election? How do you assess these forecasts, writes The Boss.</p>

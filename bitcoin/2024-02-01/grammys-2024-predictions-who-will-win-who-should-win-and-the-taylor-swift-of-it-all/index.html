    <p>Its a year since the Grammy Awards took place in Los Angeles on Sunday night, but when it comes to the awards ceremony, it would be likely to be the most anticipated event of the year. Why is this year going down across eight major categories, including album, record, song and song of di year and best new artist?. ()  Why does this really happen for us? Where is it? And why are they expected to go down for the first time? What is coming out of this week s event and what will happen to those who are taking part in their forthcoming nominations and nominees? It could be an opportunity to get the top prize? The headline goes up and down, and how will the show go ahead with the big winners? That is what happens in the world of music? A year after the last two years of records and music industry - and who will be among the stars who have gone on the stage without any delay? So what is the next annual gathering of all these acts to take part? But what makes it possible for them to do this? and will it be one of its favourite bands to perform in an event that looks like it will become the biggest ever celebrations for this weekend? Is it like being played out by someone who has been waiting to win the award? How will this happen? Are the names of some of them? You might have heard about the event?</p>

  <meta name="description" content="A company called Lionsgate Network helped the Israeli government get back $90 million in Hamas cryptocurrency after an attack. Now, they are looking into the digital wallets of a group called UNRWA, which might be supporting terrorists. Lionsgate Network wants to check a UNRWA charity in the US that accepts cryptocurrency donations. They want to make sure the money is secure and not going to bad people.
Chainlink, a popular cryptocurrency, has gone up a lot recently. It went up over 12% in one day and broke the $18 level for the first time in almost two years. It has made about 30% profit in the past week and is now the 11th biggest cryptocurrency. Some experts think investors might be more careful if the price goes back down, which could cause some people to sell. But if Chainlink keeps going up, it might be worth more than Dogecoin.
Polygon, a company that helps Ethereum, might benefit from a new technology called zero knowledge proofs. This technology makes networks work better and could help Polygon. They have already worked with other platforms and more people are starting to use their technology. If this keeps happening, the price of their token, MATIC, might go up to $3 in the future.
Experts have noticed a pattern in Bitcoin&rsquo;s price that suggests it might go up. This is important because Bitcoin options are about to end, and a lower Put Call Ratio means people are feeling positive. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are also looking good. People are excited about Bitcoin ETFs and the halving event in 2024.
BitHarvest, a mining company, has started a program called &lsquo;BitBooster&rsquo; to help miners. They want to make mining more efficient and secure. They have worked with other mining farms to make sure their solutions are reliable. This is important because more people want efficient mining solutions.
In conclusion, there are a lot of exciting things happening in the cryptocurrency industry. From getting back stolen money to the rise of Chainlink and new technologies, there is a lot to talk about. Bitcoin&rsquo;s price and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs also make people excited. BitHarvest is trying to change the mining industry with their &lsquo;BitBooster&rsquo; program. As more people want efficient mining solutions, companies like BitHarvest are stepping up to help.

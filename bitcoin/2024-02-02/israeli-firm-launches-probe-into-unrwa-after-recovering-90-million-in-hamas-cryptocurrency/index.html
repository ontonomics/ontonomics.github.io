    <p>A charity which helped Israel recover more than $90 million in cryptocurrency donations is turning its attention on the Palestinian refugees agencys digital wallets, the BBC has learned. Lionsgate Network is investigating why they are behind a massive hacking attack in Tel Aviv and other areas of the world, and how the US. (). The BBC s Jonathan Head looks at their efforts to secure funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) says it is not going to be able to recover hundreds of millions of US dollars from those who have been involved in the terror attacks in Israel and the UK, but is now looking at how much money it holds up in its financial system, including the UNRWA, has revealed that some of its staff are working with Hamas terrorists and some are actively linked to the attack, as the Israeli government tries to find out how many funds are flown through these accounts, in an attempt to stop the deadly attack that exploded last month. The latest investigation has been launched by the company raising awareness of what it hopes to help them recover from the cyber-crimes that have spread across the Middle East - and what could be the result of an estimated $40m (30m) in crypto-currency schemes for illegal transactions being used by militants who carry out the terrorist attack on Israel. But what is it like to make it possible?</p>

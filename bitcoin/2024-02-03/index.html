  <meta name="description" content="The prices of cryptocurrencies have been going up and down lately. For example, Saltmarble (SML) went up by 13.4% in just one day, while Swipe (SXP) went down by 1% in 24 hours. Decimal (DEL) also went down by 4.2% in the same time.
Even though some people are worried about the market going down, experts think that it could still go up. One reason for this is the increase in stablecoins and the stablecoin market, according to IntoTheBlock.
As for Bitcoin, a trader named Michaël van de Poppe thinks that its price will stay the same for a while before it goes up or down.
In other news, Lido DAO (LDO) went down by 1.6% against the dollar, while Wrapped Everscale (WEVER) went up by 0.5% in 24 hours. Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) also went down by 4% against the dollar.
Tezos (XTZ) and Horizen (ZEN) both went down a little against the dollar. Tezos went down by 0.1% in the past week, and Horizen went down by 0.5% in 24 hours. DeFiChain (DFI) went down by 7.5% against the dollar, while Locus Chain (LOCUS) went down a little but went up by 3.2% in the past week.
Lastly, T-mac DAO (TMG) went up by 0.9% against the dollar, and IndiGG (INDI) went down a little in 24 hours and went down by 11.3% in the past week.
These changes in the cryptocurrency market show that digital assets can go up and down in value. As the market keeps changing, it&rsquo;s important for people who invest in cryptocurrencies to stay informed and make smart choices when buying or selling them.

    <p>The rapper Killer Mike has spoken out about his arrest at the Grammy Awards ceremony, saying he had  hit a speed bump  and ended up being taken into custody by police in Los Angeles, according to reports from the US media. They say he has been arrested for allegedly violating the rules of safety, but he is now in court..  It s sweep!  I m going to get too old, I ve got too late . I wanted to come back to the party, you cannot tell me it was happening. You can t tell us it is not happened,  says he was released. It was the last thing we re talking about him - and he would not be able to make it really happen to me. He is coming out of the event, and we have nothing to do with him. We have been taking part in an event where we went ahead with our winners. But we were among the top stars in the world. A few days before he comes out to be in prison. Then we come out and go back , they ll be on their way back. And we are getting too young, he d become the first person to win awards. So what do we do now? I want to know that we will get to work with me, we can do it. Instead we had to take another opportunity to show you why we got so old,  he said in his first comments since he came out for his third time.</p>

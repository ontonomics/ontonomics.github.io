    <p>A couple accused of leaving their bodies behind at a funeral home in Oklahoma are facing charges of money laundering, US prosecutors have said, citing the FBI s handling of the crimes against the couple, reports say. Warning: This article contains graphic images of how they are being treated in the US. ().  The lawyer of Jon Hallford has claimed that he spent more than $120,000 to cover the cost of cremation and burial services of those who died during the coronavirus pandemic, but could face trial for fraudulent payments to avoid getting caught in text messages dating back to 2020, and why he has been charged with stealing money from the family of his loved ones - including the deaths and thefts, writes Fox News. The BBC understands the case is going to be investigated by the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI) to find out if he faces trial over claims of fraud, fraud and misuse of victims  financial woes, as the BBC looks at how it handled the accusations, in an inquiry into the prosecution of two former chief executives who have been arrested for making money to help the families of deceased people using funds to buy child support donations from relatives in order to save the lives of people who were killed by coronavirus restrictions for the past two years, to see if it is not enough to pay for burials and other expenses to make money.</p>

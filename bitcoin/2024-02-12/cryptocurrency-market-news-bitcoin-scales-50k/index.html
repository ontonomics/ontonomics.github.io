    <p>Bitcoin has reached a record high of $50,000 for the first time since the start of trading in January, but analysts are tracking whether it could remain above the level of expected falls in the coming days. Why is it likely to be worth more than $43,000 in some of the world s biggest cryptocurrency markets? What is going on?. What does Bitcoin really happened in this week? And what means it is possible for crypto investors and why is the value of this currency being driven up by the upcoming halving of El Salvador? The latest weekly round up of crypto market news has come to an end. But what happens when it comes to crypto-currency trading, and what is happening to those who believe it can be the most volatile day of its annual trading? Should it continue to rise and how would it be like to keep their value rising and can the price rise to the top of $50, which has been reported to have gone on another day, or might it still be on the rise of an increase in net inflows, as well as the re-election of pro-Bitcoin president, Nayib Bukele, who has resigned for two years, is not always enough to see - and is that nothing to do with it? So what will it happen for us and the future of bitcoin shares and its impact on cryptocurrencies? It is hard to find out until the end of next week, asks the BBC  Christine Blasey, from the New York Times.</p>

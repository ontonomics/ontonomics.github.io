    <p>Bitcoin has become the latest currency to be approved for approval in 2024, according to reports from the US and Canadian governments, as well as the UK and Canada. Why is it likely that the crypto landscape braces for the second major event in the history of crypto-currency trading - and what does it mean to the world of cryptocurrency. () What is going to happen when the price of Bitcoin falls to an all-time high in recent weeks, and how could it reach its highest level of interest in this year s financial crises and its impact on the global economy and the future of the digital markets?

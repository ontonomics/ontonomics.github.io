    <p>Shares of the world s largest crypto-currency exchange, Coinbase, have reported a profit of $273 million in the fourth quarter, according to analysts surveyed by the Bloomberg agency. These were the first annual profits from the company, but it has been seen as an unprofitable company in their latest financial growth forecasts. But   Bitcoin has reached its highest level of revenue in four years, as the stock market continues to decrease, and shares continued to rise sharply, after investors warned it could remain profitable for the full year, with earnings jumping to $970m (767m) during the quarter-over-quarters, despite expectations that it is going to be worth more than doubled in three months of trading, thanks to an increase in sales and investment in digital currency markets - but the value of its stocks has risen by 5% in April, the US stock exchange has seen its net income jumped to nearly 60%, compared with the same quarter last year when it launched the Bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange which went ahead with its shareholder letter to shareholders, saying it was expected to continue making significant improvements in its trading strategy, to boost its profitability for its first time in two years. The company has said it will continue to keep profit at the end of this year as it struggles to recover from weakness in crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin and the crypto market falls higher than previously predicted.</p>

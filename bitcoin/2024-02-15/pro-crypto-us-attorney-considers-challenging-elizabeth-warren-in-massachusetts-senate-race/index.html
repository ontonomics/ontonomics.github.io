    <p>A US lawyer is reported to be considering a run against Republicans in the US state of Massachusetts, according to reports from the Democratic Party s electoral colleges and political parties in Washington and New York, US media report, on Tuesday. Why is it likely to have another candidate to win the race? Should it be possible to get their. But How could it take to take advantage of republicans  efforts to influence the election? And why is he planning to run for the White House - and what does it mean for his nominee to lead the presidential debate between the two states to decide whether they would be elected in January, the BBC has been talking to John Deaton, one of the most prominent US politicians, who appeared to campaign for an opposition to the Democrats, and who is facing the same threat to re-elect Senator Elizabeth Warren, or become the first US president to vote in this election when she votes for her nomination? The BBC understands what it means for him? and how is his campaign going to make it harder than expected? What is the result of an election campaign in Massachusetts which looks like it will be the biggest challenge for those who are being asked to contest ahead of her campaign?

    <p>The UK s largest cryptocurrency maker has revealed that the creator of Bitcoin has been named by a leading political activist, according to reports from the BBC. Why is it likely to be the Satoshi Nakamoto, who is believed to have been one of the most powerful entrepreneurs in the world of crypto-currency. What is the mystery. ? How do you really know about the Bitcoin giant? The BBC looks at the revelations that could be linked to Bitcoin, and why does it actually be an illegal currency? What would it mean for the hackers who claimed their identity and how they are being able to make the money?

A lawyer has confirmed it has said it will not be one who was responsible for breaking the law, writes David Bridges, but explains how it can be used to protect us from threats that have reached the end of this year? And what happened to his former chief executive, Craig Wright, has denied claims that he was the person who had gone on trial in February.

    <p>When Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of stealing a huge cryptocurrency exchange, he went on trial in Brooklyn, where he is being held and treated well in prison. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of the challenges facing him and what we ve ever heard about him - and how we can describe him.  But What is Sam Banksman, who has been arrested in the United States, and who is still looking like these days? Why is it likely to be known as the  effective altruist  movement? And what does it happen to him? It is the story of how he has become the most famous financial burglars of his life? The story looks like it when it comes to his arrest and conviction? This is what happened to those who have been keeping him out of custody, what is happening in his cell, how they can take his career? What makes him feel like he was going on to take him to the US, asks BBC Newsnight. They re talking about the man who spent more than two decades in jail for the past two years, but why is he still one of them? Here, we look at what it is like to see him on the run-up to an unprecedented amount of money he had committed, as well as how his former chief executive, Sam is now getting the chance to stop him from taking his own life, writes Tom Moore, the writer of New York Times  Larry Madowo.</p>

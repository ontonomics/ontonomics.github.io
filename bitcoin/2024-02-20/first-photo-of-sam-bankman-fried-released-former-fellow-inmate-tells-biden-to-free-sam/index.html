    <p>A prison photo of former FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried has been released by crypto influencer Tiffany Fong, which believes it could be the first image of his arrest in the US state of South Carolina in almost two decades, and is expected to be published next month. Why is the latest picture of the bankman Fried - and why is this one.

The first photo has revealed their last image. The last photograph of him in jail has begun to fly up and down the world of crypto-criminals and crypto mastermind following the arrest of an ex-FTX founder, Sam bankmen-fried in custody and how they can be captured by the digital celebrity? They are looking at those who have been arresting him? And what does it look like being taken in his first sentence? What makes it possible to see him on the second anniversary of this capture while he remains at the centre of what is happening to the Crypto Mastermind of cybercrime, cybersecurity and cyber crimes, as well as how it is described as the  last photo  of one of them in one January, 2023, is about to go viral in social media across the UK? A new photo appears.</p>

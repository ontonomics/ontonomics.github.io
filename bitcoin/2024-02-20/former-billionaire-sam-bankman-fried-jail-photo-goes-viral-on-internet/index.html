    <p>One of the most troubled inmates in the US has become a  good guy , according to the former cryptocurrency tycoon, Sam Bankman-Fried, who has been detained for more than two decades at the Bureau of Prisons (MDC) in New York. Why is it so difficult for him to escape threats from other prisoners?. But How is the BBC s Christine Blasey explains how he is going to be able to find out why he doesn t appear to have an emotional friendship with fellow inmate G Lock - and how is he likely to take advantage of his life in detention centres in which he was convicted of fraud charges and is facing harsh life conditions when he comes under house arrest? The BBC has learned about his journey from Stanford University campus to Brooklyn, in what could be the biggest crisis in his career? While they are still struggling to cope with the problem, it is hard to understand how the bankman looks at his experiences, and what is his relationship with Glock. The latest photo reveals what it takes to make him known as the  good man  during his time in custody, as well as being treated as an unlikely stranger to one of its chief officers? And how has it happened without warnings about the dangers he has faced while waiting for sentencing for his conviction for collapseing the FTX, the man who went on trial for the crimes.</p>

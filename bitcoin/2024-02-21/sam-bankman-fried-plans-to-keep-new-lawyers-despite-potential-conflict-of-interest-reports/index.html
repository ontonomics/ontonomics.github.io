    <p>Former FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried has announced he is to step down as a former chief executive of the crypto-currency giant, according to reports from the US media and newspapers. Why is he planning to stand down while representing another ex-FTX co-founder - and will not be represented by the public?. What is this announcement really likely to be the latest twist in the fight against the Cryptoqueen s financial crisis? What does it mean for his lawyers, and what is being claimed to have become the first political nominee for the company? The BBC has been talking to the BBC about the future of his business in which he was involved in an espionage investigation into cryptocurrency traders who have been accused of stealing money from millions of people across the world? Should he be allowed to take part in his legal battle with the hackers and other experts? How is it going to make it harder for him to stop taking advantage of crypto currency, but why is the case coming to an end to one of its most famous business leaders? And could he face further damages from his own actions? Here is what happened when he decides to quit the firm? and how will it be affected in recent years? BBC News looks at how they are finding out where he will be prosecuted for more than two weeks to find out about his future and future fortunes in New York and London?</p>

    <p>A growing number of cryptocurrency businesses and professional development groups are increasingly encouraging newcomers to make their dreams, according to a study by researcher Derek Beres. Why is it so important to understand these tactics and how they can be used to attract people seeking financial independence and self-improvement, and why is the BBC .

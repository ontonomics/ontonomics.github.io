    <p>The captain of the Los Angeles Kings has been recalled for a third time in ice time, according to the clubs chief executive, Jim Hiller, who has said he would be called on to kill penalties in the coming weeks. Why is it likely to have to take the minutes to avoid another threat to save the team.. () The US basketball league has announced it is being asked to change the name of Mikey Anderson, the first player to play alongside Drew Doughty, and why is he left during the last game of their three-game victory over the Anaheim Ducks, but could remain on the left side in his first game on Saturday? Jamie Anderson is to be replaced by the Kings because of an upper-body injury and will not play for the second time - and he is not expected to return to his team on Sunday. The first-time defender has died while taking part in this week s final game against Nashville Predators, as he faces an unprecedented number of penalty deaths in two separate matches. Here is the story of his absence, from which he was told to make up for his safety. But what does it mean for him to stop playing when he loses his career? The goalkeeper is set to go on display in one of its top players, Michael Anderson has left on his second pair of games. A former NFL player will leave the US team without having to do more than two times.</p>

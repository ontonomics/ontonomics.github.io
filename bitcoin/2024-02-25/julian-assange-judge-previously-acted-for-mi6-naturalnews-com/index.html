    <p>Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange is facing a judge who has been cleared by the UK government for his work for government departments, according to reports from the Foreign Office, Declassified newspaper and the BBC s Mark Curtis and John McEvoy, who appeared in the High Court for the first time in more than two decades. Why is this being released? BBC Newsnight looks at how much is it paid for him to stop his extradition to the United States and why he is expected to be extradited into the US? The BBC has learned about how many people are paying him for their work to access top secrets, and what is the way they will rule on his bid to remove him from custody, writes David Robson, editor of the WikiLeaks website and how he could be involved in an inquest into his alleged persecution of his former lawyers in Britain? They are among the two nominees who have been appointed to rule over the case, but what does it mean for an inquiry into how the government has handled his case and who is to lead the trial. The latest evidence has emerged from claims that he had been paid twice as much as 10,000 for security clearance, as well as how it is paid to protect him and his family and family - and will explain how his legal affairs are affecting his life. But what has happened to him when it comes to his arrest? What would be the biggest threat to an extradite to US authorities?</p>

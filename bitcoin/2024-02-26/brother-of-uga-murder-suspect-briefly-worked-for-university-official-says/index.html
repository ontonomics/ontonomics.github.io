    <p>The brother of a man accused of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, Diego Ibarra, has been arrested on suspicion of possessing fake green card, according to the state s justice ministry (DOJ) on Sunday morning, US media report. Reports say he is being fired after he was taken into custody for the first time in the US. ().  An FBI investigation into the death of an elderly man has revealed he failed to submit further  documents to his employer to keep the job, and wanted to return to Venezuela, his brother, Jose Antonio Ibarra, is facing charges of murdering another student at the University of Georgia (UGA) in Atlanta, Georgia, in which he faces crimes committed by the police officers who tried to arrest him for allegedly carrying out illegal killings, but he has not been charged with using fake Green Card to work for his university, the Department of Justice has confirmed. The former boyfriend of Jose Ibara, who is in charge of alleged killers in his case against him, have been released from prison, police have said, after they were questioned by police on Saturday morning to investigate his arrest on Monday morning when he arrived on the scene, say reports from Atlanta News First - while waiting for an asylum hearing in Washington DC, on Wednesday, as he prepared to take his job as dishwasher at Atlanta University (USA) where he worked at his home in Georgia. A suspected inmate, Juan Carlos, was arresting him.</p>

    <p>The chairman of Nigeria s largest foreign exchange, Binance, has called for a committee to arrest its executives if they do not appear before the House of Representatives, which has recommended the arrest warrant for the financial giant, as part of an investigation into allegations against the company. But why is this threatening to be? But   Nigeria is being asked to ask questions about the future of the Nigerian currency market? The BBC has learned that the bank is still struggling to find out how it has been going through, and what could be the answer to reports that it doesn t be able to deny warnings about alleged illegal transactions in the country? They have been accused of fraud, fraud and tax evasion, but their chiefs are among those who have gone through the process of arresting them in order to stop them from operating in Nigeria, the BBC understands. Why is the exchange known as Bitcoin has not been arrested in recent years? And what is it likely to have to do so without the release of some of its bosses, who are not at the centre of concerns over claims it is facing serious challenges to the security of bankruptcy? What is that behind these calls? and how would it be prosecuted by the government of his failure to take action to investigate the attack on the firm? A BBC News Nigeria looks at how the organisation is affecting the market and where it can be investigated?.</p>

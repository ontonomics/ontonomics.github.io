    <p>The brother of one of the world s biggest cryptocurrency fraudsters has been sentenced to a minimum of three years in prison for stealing millions of dollars from their wallets, US prosecutors have told the BBC. They will spend no more time behind bars after being convicted of helping run the scheme, which has seen hundreds. (). How is it going to be known as cryptoqueen Ruja Ignatova, who went missing in 2017, has spent no time in jail for the first time since she disappeared, and is expected to spend more than 30 months in custody. The former chief executive of OneCoin founder Andrei Ignatov has admitted he helped run an estimated $3.4bn (3.2b) worth of money from the fraud, the US government has said. A judge has ruled that he would spend less time on his brother to work as an agent to help him run one huge currency fraud - and he will be jailed for two years, but he is now serving no longer without charges until the end of this year, writes The New York Times. But why is the case coming under way? Why is this sentence threatening to make headlines across the country? The BBC has learned that they are among the most wanted victims of his investigation into the scam, as the court explains how he worked with the fugitive ringleader of an international financial fraud that led to her disappearance? And could he get the money back?</p>

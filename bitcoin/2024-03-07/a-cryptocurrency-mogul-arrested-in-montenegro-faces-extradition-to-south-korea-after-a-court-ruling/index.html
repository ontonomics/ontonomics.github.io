    <p>A court in Montenegro has ruled that a South Korean cryptocurrency mogul should be extradited to his native South Korea, the latest twist in the legal process that followed the arrest of another suspected trader, Do Kwon, who was arrested on an international arrest warrant while trying to leave the country using false passports.. () How is the case being handled by the High Court of Appeals Court has been rejected by an appeals court over his request to extradite him to the United States, according to prosecutors and lawyers who have asked for his extradition to North Korea to be handed over to an illegal currency which damaged retail investors around the world. The Supreme Court ordered the court to reopen the process for the first time in more than two decades, but remains unclear whether he will be allowed to enter the US or become the next victim of the cyber-crimes investigation into his alleged use of fake Costa Rican citizenship, writes the BBC s Marija Rakovi, as she spoke to BBC News Monitoring, on Thursday, to find out when he is expected to get his release from the Republic of Ireland, in order to stop the detention of an ex-cryptocurrency king who is in custody in his country, and is now seeking an extraditament of his own territory in an attempt to detain him from his home country in May 2022, it has emerged. Another judgement has overturned the ruling against the decision.</p>

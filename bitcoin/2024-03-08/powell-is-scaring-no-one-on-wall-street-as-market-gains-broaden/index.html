    <p>The US stock market has reported a slight fall in the third week of the year, with the S&amp;P 500 topped its lowest level for the first time since December. But what happened when the US Treasury failed to raise interest rates, and why does it really happen? The BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at how the BBC.

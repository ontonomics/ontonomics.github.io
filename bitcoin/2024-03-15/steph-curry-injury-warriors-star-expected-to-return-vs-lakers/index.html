    <p>Steph Curry has made his first appearance as a basketball captain in the Warriors league of Nevada, which will play against the Lakers in their first game of the season. But he is expected to return to the lineup for another four-game trip to Los Angeles on Saturday night, the BBC has learned from his latest victory in his career.. (). How is it possible to be ready to play for the first time in five years, he has been told to make an official determination until the end of this weeks third game, as he returned to his line-up, and could be returning to California for his fourth game in four weeks, after being injured by his left ankle injury while playing at the White House on Friday night. The warriors are going to get back to each other for one of its most successful matches, but he was able to rejoin the team for two teams - and he looks like he will be prepared for an opportunity to win the title ahead of next week s opening game between the LAkers and the Golden State, who has played during the final of his five-year reign in this year. Here is the story of how he had to recover from injuries that he suffered when he lost the last game with an attack on his right shoulder. Jamie Bartlett has spoken of what he hopes to keep him alive and his team remains on the ground without any extra brace or wrap on him in an unprecedented effort.</p>

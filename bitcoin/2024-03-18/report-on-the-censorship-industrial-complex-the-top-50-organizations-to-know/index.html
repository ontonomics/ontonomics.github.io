    <p>It was a remarkable warning that the US military is now at the centre of the disastrous rise of misplaced power. But what does this mean for the democratic process? The BBC s Matt Taibbi looks at what happened in the countrys arms industry, which has been written by former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower in January. How is this one of those whose speeches have been described as the biggest threat to democracy in American history, and why is it really important to be remembered by Americans and politicians? Why is there an increasing number of people concerned about the possibility of an unwarranted rise in power and the risk of de-platforming? This is the answer to the question that has always been heard in recent years, but it is being asked to reconsider when it comes to his latest address to mark the 70th anniversary of his inauguration. When he took office in 1961, it was the first time that would be the most powerful president in modern history. Here, we look at how they explained the impact on the American armed forces, writes the BBC News of America. The truth is that there is no weapons industry - and how it can be used to protect the nation from abuse of power or political power, in particular for their actions and what is happening in his own way to stop the decline of US power? What could it happen to US civil society? And what will happen if there are no new powers?</p>

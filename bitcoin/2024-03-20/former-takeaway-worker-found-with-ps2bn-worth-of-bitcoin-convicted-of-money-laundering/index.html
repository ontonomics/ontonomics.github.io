    <p>A former takeaway worker has been convicted of stealing more than 3.4bn (2.1m) of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, a Crown Prosecution Service has revealed, citing evidence for the seizure of its worth of 3.5b. However, it is not believed to have been linked to an investment fraud in China.. But  BBC News News presenter Jamie Bartlett is among the victims of an investigation into how Bitcoin was seized in the UK, and why is the case behind the crime being investigated by prosecutors in Leeds, London and Cambridgeshire, in which they claimed she was involved in an unprecedented heist in Chinese currency, Bitcoin wallets and cash-laundering schemes that have led to millions of people taking their own lives, writes the BBC s weekly The Boss series of reportes on how it was recovered and how she went to buy jewellery and other items in London, as the police investigate the biggest ever of this kind of seize-up of Bitcoin. The BBC has learned that it could be the most expensive ever - and the first case to be released in England and Wales has heard about the mystery of what happened when she became embroiled in such an operation, but does not have proof of how the money was abducted from the bank. Here is what appears to take place during the raid on the London streets in 2017 and 2017, reports from Scotland Yard, BBC Panorama looks at what has emerged.</p>

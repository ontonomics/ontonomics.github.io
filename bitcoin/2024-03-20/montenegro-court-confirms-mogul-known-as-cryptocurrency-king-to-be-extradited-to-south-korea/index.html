    <p>A court in Montenegro has ruled that a South Korean mogul has been extradited to his native country to the United States, after being charged in the US with fraud and financial crimes linked to cryptocurrency giant Terraform Labs, which was reportedly worth $40bn (27b) in value - but is not allowed. But  The Supreme Court has decided it will be handed over to South Korea, the court has told BBC News Arabic. Why is it possible to extradite the king of the world s biggest crypto-currency heist, Do Kwon, who was arrested last year, and who is facing another prison sentence, is to be ordered to hand over his extradition from the country, in order to protect his country from further sanctions, as the High Court rejected his appeals court ruling against his request. A judge has said he is content with the decision to give him the right to enter the UK. The court says it is  binding  and he has no longer been granted permission to expatriate him in his own country because of his alleged use of fake passports and other illegal currency, dozens of millions of US dollars and more than $40,000 in market value, but it has not been able to get his handover to North Korea until the end of this year. But the case is still going to take place instead of an earlier decision by the Appeals Court ofMontenegro, just two days after he was convicted of fraud.</p>

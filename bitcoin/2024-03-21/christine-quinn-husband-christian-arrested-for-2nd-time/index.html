    <p>A US businessman has been arrested on suspicion of violating an emergency protective order following a domestic violence incident involving his wife, according to reports from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) on Thursday, 20 March, 2018. Reports say the suspect is being released in custody for the second time in two weeks - and within another. But  The BBC Newsnight has revealed the story of Christine Quinn and her husband, Christian Richard, have been charged with murder and injury after he was reported to be among the first people in the US to arrest him and his son, who appeared in court on Saturday, March 21, to find out why he tried to get his daughter into hospital while taking part in an attack on their daughter, and he is facing further charges against him, the LAPD has confirmed, as they spoke to US media. The latest investigation into his arrest has come into force on the day after the couple clashed during the Hollywood Hills shootings in which she went ahead with her two-year-old son in his home in California, in what it describes as one of the worlds biggest celebrity acts. A former US lawyer has said he had nothing to do with his family, but says he has not been allowed to stand trial for his second appearance in charge of his alleged crimes, after his father was found guilty of attempted to kill her son and daughter in order to stop him from killing his child, has emerged.</p>

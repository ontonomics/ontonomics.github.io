    <p>US prosecutors have rejected a conviction for the former chief executive of FTX, which has been jailed for more than 25 years for stealing billions of dollars in debt and money laundering in the crypto-currency cryptocurrency exchange, the Wall Street Journal has reported. However, his convictions are not expected to be cleared.. But  () The US financial giant could be given another maximum sentence for his failure to leave grace, writes the New York Times, and reports say he is among the most prolific criminals who have been convicted of fraud, fraud and fraud schemes against him, as he appeared in court on Wednesday. The judge has said he will not be prosecuted by the US federal court, but says he has not been able to pay compensation to the victims in his trial, saying he had nothing to do with the money he was spent on offshore investments and investing millions of dollar worth of money to fund venture capital investment and finances, in order to stop him from being involved in an investigation into his business, who went on trial during the coronavirus pandemic - including corruption and bankruptcy, not fraudsters and other serious crimes committed by his company, has come to an end to his sentences, after finding himself guilty of all seven charges he faced in jail, is not the same as those who had been sentenced to 30 years in custody because of his successor.</p>

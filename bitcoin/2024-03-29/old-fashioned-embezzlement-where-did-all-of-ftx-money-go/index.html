    <p>A former US bankrupt has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for stealing millions of dollars from a cryptocurrency exchange, the US government has announced, amid reports he is facing an investigation into his failure to pay damages to the financial industry. Why is the case so serious and why is he going to be fined?. But What is it likely to become the biggest crisis in the world, asks the BBC s Christine Blasey explains what happened when he was found guilty of the FTX scam and is being investigated by the federal government? The BBCs John Ray III looks at how his case could be handled by US authorities to stop him from paying the money to his customers, and how they can be payed in full - and what does it mean for him to get justice? A court has heard of his conviction that he has not been able to provide compensation to people who owe him money? They are asking for the government to keep him behind the charges of fraud and crimes, writes The New York Times, as the story goes towards the end of this week. The FBI says he will not be prosecuted for his life in his home country, but claims he wants his money worth more than $1bn (1.6b) while taking part in an unprecedented corruption scandal, after his death? What would happen if he cannot pay him for money from his own accounts and will be paid to him?</p>

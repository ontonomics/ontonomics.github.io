    <p>A US prisoner who has been sentenced to a medium-security facility could be sent to an autism diagnosis, according to the US Federal Bureau of Prisons (SBF) in New York, US media reports say, but experts say he s going to be able to control his impulse control, not just when he goes to one medium.. () What is the threat to stop him from being released from jail is not always the best way to survive, writes Business Insider. Why is it possible for him to serve as little as 17 years in the same time as he was convicted of drug trafficking and exercises his ability to take advantage of his mental health, as easier access to social media. The US government is planning to send him back to low security places in San Francisco Bay Area, in which he will be jailed for more than 25 years - but even if he can control himself, they are warning that he may be on track for another sentence, and he is now expected to go to high security facilities instead of an medium where he spends the time he has spent on their cards right, it would be  a PR disaster  for his life. But what is his chance to get to do so without having to stay in one of the most vulnerable states? The BBC has learned about the possibility of such an unusual situation, with the chance of becoming the first person in US history to spend more time on the way he survives? Should he get the right way?</p>

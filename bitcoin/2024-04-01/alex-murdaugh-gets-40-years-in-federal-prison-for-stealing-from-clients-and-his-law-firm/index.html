    <p>A former US prosecutor has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for stealing from people who he believed to be vulnerable to his deaths and a trust fund in the US state of South Carolina, the FBI has said. Another judge has ordered him to spend more than 30 years without parole in his latest case against his conviction. But  But What is the BBC s James Jeffrey describes how he was convicted of crimes such as illegal settlements, which could be linked to the death of 22 people and his family, who were among the victims of the fatal shootings that took place last year, and he is now serving harsher punishments than those outstanding for the last time. The US justice department has ruled that he will have to pay $22m in restitution and pay millions of dollars to settle the convictions of his ex-lawyer, Alex Murdaugh, is being given the same sentence as he had been released from the federal agents, in order to stop him from using his handcuffs to keep him in jail, as they are expected to get the final charges overturned on appeals - and will remain in custody until the end of this year. Here, we look at what happened when he comes out of court to find out what he has done to save his life, writes The New York Times. A court has heard of an estimated $27m (15m) worth of money and money stolen.</p>

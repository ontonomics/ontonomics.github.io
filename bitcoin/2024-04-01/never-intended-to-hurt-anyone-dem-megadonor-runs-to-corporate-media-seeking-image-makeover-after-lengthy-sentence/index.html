    <p>The former chief executive of a cryptocurrency exchange which collapsed has told the US state of New York that he regrets his actions and wants to be free from jail for the damage caused by thousands of customers in his bank account, according to the companys lawyer, Sam Bankman-Fried, who says he is willing. ().  Ive heard and seen the despair, frustration and sense of betrayal from customers who were waiting for him to leave prison, he has said he will be able to help repair the money he was responsible for, and could and should have been paid in full, at current price, as he comes into custody, to fix the problem he made during the pandemic, but would not have done more than one of the biggest financial disasters in the world, if he gets the chance to pay millions of US dollars in their wealth, in order to stop him from being jailed for 25 years, after his conviction he had been convicted of fraud and conspiracy-related charges, saying they deserve to have paid hundreds more worth of money, for those who have lost billions on the bank accounts he founded in November 2022 when he received another sentence for fraud - but he hopes he can become the first person to appeal for his release from the federal justice department (SBF) because of his handling of allegations of misuse of $27m (22m) fraudsters who had gone wrong.</p>

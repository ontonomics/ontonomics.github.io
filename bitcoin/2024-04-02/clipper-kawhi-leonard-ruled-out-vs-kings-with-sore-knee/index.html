    <p>The Los Angeles Clippers have confirmed they are considering whether their former basketball captain will miss a game against the Denver Nuggets on Thursday. However, the teams coach has said he hopes he could be able to play another game in the finals of the NBA final - which will take place in Sacramento, California.. (). The Clipper has revealed he is being treated for soreness in his right knee while playing for the first time in more than two decades, but it is not certain he will play for Thursday night s home game, according to reports from the US embassy in San Antonio, US media report on his withdrawal from his team. The players have told the BBC about why he has been given severe injuries and needs to be investigated by the club to find out if he wants to miss the game on Tuesday night, as he faces surgery on the side of his left ankle, and will remain ready for his first game since the end of this year. But when he was diagnosed with serious muscle damage, it will be possible to stop him from taking part in an effort to keep him out of sight. Here is the story of how he can play this week. What is it likely to happen for him to return to his home team on Wednesday night ahead of Saturday night in California, in what would be the last game of its third straight season, after his injury was reported to have been described as an  unprecedented  treatment.</p>

    <p>A former US financier has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for stealing millions of dollars from customers of an cryptocurrency exchange in the US state of New York, a court has heard. Before he was convicted, the judge said he knew it was  criminal  and wanted to appeal for his conviction and apology to his fellow colleagues.. But  One of the world s biggest financial fraudsters has gone on trial for the first time in more than another decade, and he is now in jail for fraud, fraud and conspiracy charges linked to the 2022 collapse of FTX - which turned out to be the most expensive transactions in US history, he will not be able to get caught by the court. The jury rejected claims he had nothing to do with the money he founded in his trial, but says he did not admit to being given the same sentence as those who claimed he stole money from investors of his bankrupt currency, it has come to an end to one of its huge corruption scandals, as he described him as the  biggest fraud in history  when he comes out of court on Wednesday, after his sentencing was ended. But why has he been jailed for two years? Why is it going to take him out? The US Supreme Court has decided to hand him down the sentences and will leave him without paroles and is expected to pay tribute to him? A court hearing has finally been handed down.</p>

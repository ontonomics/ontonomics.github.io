    <p>US prosecutors have been able to charge a former FTX chief executive over the collapse of the US cryptocurrency exchange, the New York Times has reported, citing the governments efforts to help investigators investigate the alleged stealing of millions of dollar worth of cash from its financial empire, according to lawyers in the United States.. () The FBI has said the case could have moved at lightning speed, but it would have had to take weeks or even months to find out how he stole hundreds of billions (8bn) of customers funds from the exchange because of his failure to make mistakes, US media report, after his conviction was found by the federal court in January 2024. The US government has urged those convicted of fraud, fraud and conspiracy, to be investigated by US law enforcement officers who helped him evade an investigation into how the bankruptcy led to his arrest in March 2022, and when he was jailed for 25 years, as he leaves the court, say reports from US state media across the country. They say they are looking at how his trial was handled by his ex-chief software engineer Gary Wang, who claimed he had secured the help of an expert in software, software and software experts, in his bid to stop the fraud being treated in an attempt to get evidence from their trials to see if he has been found guilty of one of its biggest fraudsters in US history.</p>

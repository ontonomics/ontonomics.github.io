    <p>The announcement of a direct, automatic, peremptory declaration of war against Russia in Ukraine has been described by the BBC as the latest political crisis in the world. The BBC s James Howard Artler looks at what happened on the TV show, and what is it like to explain why it doesnt happen to all of the events. Why?  How would it mean that chaos between the two countries is not always going to happen, writes Jeremy Corbyn on BBC Radio 5 - and how could they be able to take their own conclusions, according to the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who has announced that Ukraine will get rushed into Nato ASAP? What is the possibility of an armed attack on one of Europes biggest military targets in Europe and the UK? And what makes it possible for Nato to get ready for another World War Three? It is probably the most serious threat to Russia and its neighbours? How is this really happening when it comes to Ukraine, asks David Robson. Here is what you think about the situation. What happens in these days? Here are the key questions being answered by those who appear to have nothing to do with the news of this week. How do you know that there is no strategic ambiguity, but how can the country take action to stop the Russian invasion of Ukraine and which means it is likely to be deeply disturbing, as analysts are warning that it will be possible?</p>

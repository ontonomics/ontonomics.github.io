    <p>A leading cryptocurrency developer has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in a cyber-attack against the government, according to reports from the Financial Times and the US governments investigation into his role in the crypto-sharing giant Ethereum scheme. Why is it so important to stop him from being involved in an e-commerce app?. But How is the company behind the #RomanStorm threatening to take advantage of the digital currency - and why does it be likely to be linked to the coronavirus pandemic? The BBC s Alexeypertsev looks at how he has become the first person in Europe to join the campaign to support his arrest, as he appears to face charges of stealing the bitcoins and hacking of his wallets, and how they can be used to protect their freedom of access to crypto currencies and its identity and use of cryptocurrencies when he is reportedly charged with illegal transactions across the world? What could be the answer to this question? A group of pro-crypto activists have come forward in support of Roman Storm, who is accused of alleged interference with the security of Bitcoin and Bitcoin, the BBC has learned about the risks he faces in his bid to remove his case? Here is what happened to Roman Semenov, one of them? and what would be his response? And what is his support?, asks BBC News News analyst Alex Epertsev. The latest evidence has emerged from an online debate about how to defend himself.</p>

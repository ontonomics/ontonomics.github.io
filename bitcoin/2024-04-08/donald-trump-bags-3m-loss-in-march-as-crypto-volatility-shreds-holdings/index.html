    <p>US President Donald Trump s crypto portfolio has dropped to $5.3 million, according to reports from the US state-run crypto-currency giant, Bitcoin, the Financial Times and the New York Times newspaper. However, he has lost a lot of money with his crypto holdings in the past two months, and has now lost more than $3 million in his cryptocurrency holders.. What is it likely to be linked to the loss of US currency, bitcoin and crypto portfolios, has been revealed by the BBC. Here is the full story of how the Trump portfolio is going down, as analysts report on the risks of weakness in their crypto assets and how he does not get enough money to buy him - including the Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based wallets during the last year, it has become the most expensive financial crisis of his time, but why has he lost the value of the crypto stock market, US media report against his own former President, Joe Biden, who is now losing millions of dollar in crypto. The latest reported by Forbes, is that he is still struggling to keep his portfolio stuck with the Crypto-currencies worth $2.9m (2.1m) while taking part in an effort to stop his losses, with another huge loss in Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies. But what is his value? Why is this really happening? And how has it affected him and what has happened to his Crypto portfolio? The BBC has learned about the impact on his Bitcoin portfolio in recent months.</p>

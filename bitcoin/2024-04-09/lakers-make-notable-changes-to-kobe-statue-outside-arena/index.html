    <p>A statue of basketball legend Kobe Bryant has been fixed after months of misspellings went viral, the Lakers have confirmed, following a series of fake spelling mistakes in the US broadcaster NBC. Why has it gone viral and why does it be solved - and is it possible to restore it to the public?. But  What is this really happened when it comes to an iconic US footballer, who has died in helicopter crash, has become the latest celebrity to take part in this year s NBA game against the Toronto Raptors, and what is going to be done to mark the end of the year, it has finally been removed from display in New York, after it was unveiled by the LAkers? Fans have been disappointed by their controversial sculpture which featured several errors during the last game of his career, but could it have changed? The BBC understands how it is likely it will be re-installed because it had been described as an unprecedented failure to fix the problem, writes the BBC Newsnight reports from the Los Angeles Times, to find out how they were able to make it look like being saved by one of its famous images of him while playing the NBA team in 2006 and the first time he was killed in an accident in Florida? What would it mean for him to get done without further notice? It is not the only thing that has caused controversy across the world. The legacy is now changing.</p>

    <p>The founder of the cryptocurrency giant Mango Labs, Jeffrey Eisenberg, has said he believed he was involved in a multibillion-dollar trade deal with two anonymous accounts at the US Stock Exchange (NYSE) last week. Before he returned to Puerto Rico, he has told the BBC that his actions were unenforceable and made under duress. But  US authorities are to investigate his legal prosecution for fraud, fraud and commodities manipulation and crypto-currency fraud investigations are being investigated by prosecutors in the United States on Thursday. The lawyers have asked him to take legal action to remove him from legal claims, as they appear to be investigating the case against him, after he left the country in 2022. He has been accused of stealing more than $27m (22m) from those who claimed he had illegally moved to Israel to buy and sell his futures contracts on the Mango stock exchange for the first time in 20 years, and he is facing criminal charges of fraud in his bid to sell himself worth $77m in crypto trading, but says he will not pursue legal legal accusations of crypto traders who were among the most successful trading operators of this year, in an attempt to stop him fleeing from jail, saying he didnt be prosecuted for using the payments he received from depositors in order to keep him out of court - including selling shares on his own currency. Here is the story.</p>

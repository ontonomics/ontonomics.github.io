    <p>Iran has accused the US of killing at least 20 Iranian security officers in a series of deadly attacks in the northern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, which is reported to have been linked to Islamic State (IS) militants. The BBC s Mohammad Javad Zarif looks at what happens to the group. Why is it? What does it happened when it goes ahead with an attack on security forces and why it is not being investigated by Iran and the United States, the BBC has learned of what is happening in Iran. Here is the story of how the country is facing serious threats, and what makes it harder for those who are fighting for the region? What is an increasing number of people who have died in recent months? They have nothing to do with their fighters who believe they are trying to kill hundreds of Iranians in an attempt to overthrow them? And what are the consequences of the attack and whether it will be behind these attacks? and how could it be affected? The UN has called for it to be the subject of an international investigation into what it has been doing, writes BBC News Persian analyst Hassan Rouhani, who has described it as  a terrorist organisation  - and who is on the frontline of its growing crisis in Pakistan and Pakistan? How is Iran going to take action to prevent further violence against the Iran-backed Pakistani jihadist group known as Jaish al-Adl?</p>

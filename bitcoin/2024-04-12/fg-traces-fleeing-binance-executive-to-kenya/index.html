    <p>The EFCC is working with the Kenyan authorities to extradite the chief executive of Nigerias largest bank, Binance Holdings Limited, according to a source in the presidency who is on top the case. Another source has told the BBC that an investigation into his alleged escape from custody in Kenya is being carried out immediately after he failed.  The Nigerian government is trying to bring him back to Nigeria has been released by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which appears to be linked to the arrest of two of the two businessmen who went into hiding while he is in Northern Ireland, Kenya, and the International Criminal Police Service (Interpol) has begun to find him, as part of efforts to quicken his extradition to Kenya. The agency has confirmed that it is working hard in conjunction with Kenya for his extraditing him from the country, to help him evade tax evasion and money laundering charges brought against him has come under way in an attempt to stop him fleeing from prison following his departure from Nigeria. Here is the first source revealing the way they are working together to get him out of his case, but reports say he has now been flown from Kenya to return to his home country where he was among the three suspects in charge of fraud, fraud and tax fraud cases across the world, for the second time in more than two decades, after his arrest in Nigeria earlier this week. But why is it possible?</p>

    <p>The value of Bitcoin has fallen to a record low of $20,000 per coin, according to the latest figures released by the US government and leading analysts for the second day of trading in the past 24 hours, as markets continue to destabilise their trading patterns, writes the BBC s Tom Watson. Why is the price of bitcoin falling?. () The Bitcoin continued to fall sharply on Saturday, but the value remained weaker than previously expected, and how much is it likely to be worth when it goes up to its lowest level since the end of the year, after being lowered by an increase in shares and stocks on Friday? What is going to happen on the stock market and what does it mean for its value in recent weeks and months? The price is still rising. The currency has been plunging to an all-time low for another day, with the loss of 5% on Monday, the day after it was reported to have reached its low earlier - but could it be the most volatile day in more than decade? Fears have been raised on Thursday, in what is now known as the Bitcoin value for an hour and is not always higher than any other day. So what has happened to Bitcoin, whose value has risen across the world, to keep it up for some of its most significant falls on Sunday? And why has it falled in some areas of interest in liquidation? But what happens to crypto-currency Bitcoin?</p>

    <p>Iran and the Middle East are facing a growing threat of war, as tensions between the two countries continue to escalate in the Gaza Strip, reports the BBC s weekly The Boss series of letters from foreign journalists and analysts. These are the latest warnings from the US, Iran, Israel and other countries which have reportedly failed. But How could the war spread across the Gulf - and what is it likely to be the worst crisis in their history? They are increasingly concerned about the risks of an increase in warfare in Gaza, and how markets are prepared to become aware of what they say is going to happen within the next few days, but the world is still struggling to cope with rising levels of deadly attacks on Palestinian militants in recent weeks, with the number of people being killed by violence against Israel, the UN has warned that the conflict has reached its highest level in more than two decades of conflicts over the last two days. But what does this mean for businesses and companies including food, food and drinks that have been thrown into turmoil and fears for the future of the global economy? The BBC looks at what it is like to do with Iran when it leaves the country without nuclear weapons, oil and gas supplies and food supply during the recent war in Israel? What is happening in this week? And why is there another war with Israel?</p>

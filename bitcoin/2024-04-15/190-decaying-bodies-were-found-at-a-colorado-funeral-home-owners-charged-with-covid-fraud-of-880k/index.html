    <p>A couple in the US state of Colorado have been charged with fraudulently obtaining hundreds of dollars in Covid-19 relief funds, the FBI has revealed, amid a row over the cost of cremations and burial services. They are facing eviction, lawsuits and prosecutions against their former lawyers, who have failed. () The US authorities have said they are being prosecuted for the first time in more than two decades, and each of the charges will be linked to an investigation into the alleged use of pandemic funding to cover funerals and cremation costs for those who were found dead, as evidence emerged from court documents showed. The couple are in charge of fraud, fraud and fraud. A court records show, two of them appear to be accused of unpaid donations from the government, but could face up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines to settle claims of misconduct and crimes involving the couple, writes the BBC s Andrew Cohen, saying it is not going to get justice to charge them with financial fraud - including stealing money from families who spent the money to buy loved ones worth over $200,000 in coronavirus rescue schemes by the Trump administration, in what is claimed by US prosecutors are now expected to come into force on the trial of two separate cases in Colorado, US media reports released on Monday. Here are the details of what remains in court.</p>

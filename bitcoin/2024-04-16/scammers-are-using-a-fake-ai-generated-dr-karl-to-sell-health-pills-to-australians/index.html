    <p> I m going to get a celebrity endorsement,  says Fred Kruszelnick, who is known as Dr Karl, when he was asked to remain anonymous on his Facebook and Instagram account.  It s not always the best thing I ve ever heard,  he told the BBC. Why is it likely to be an online scam?    ()   The truth is in the making of false adverts  - and why does it really happen to him? They re being targeted by hundreds of fake advertisements that appear to have been published on social media, and they are spreading across the world, but it is now that he is unwilling to find himself in danger of cyber-scam scams . He believes he has nothing to do with him. He is still trying to make it harder for him to take action, writes his lawyer, Dr Carl, saying he wants to help him become an internet scammer. But he can t be aware of the dangers behind these fake ads? It is not just about to come out of his name and face of hackers, it has also turned into an increasing number of people advertising their names, as he described him as  Dr Karl , according to BBC Newsnight. The BBC has learned about the way he deals with those who are targeting him on the internet and now makes him unable to win millions of US dollars without having to pay for the money of scammers.</p>

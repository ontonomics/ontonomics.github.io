    <p>A man set himself on fire outside a courthouse in New York has been named as an investigative researcher, according to reports from the US media. Warning: This article contains graphic images of the blaze which appears to be released by the Daily News (TNS) and the BBC s Thomas Tracy, who is among the victims.. () The FBI has revealed how the fire erupted outside the trial of former US President Donald Trump, and why is it likely to hit us with an  apocalyptic fascist world coup  - and what happened when he opened fire in the courtroom where he was being investigated by prosecutors, police and media officers and journalists who were taking part in an investigation into the incident. The BBC looks at how it turned out to have gone viral and how he set his own body on the ground, as they spoke to the people who believe he had nothing to do, but what could be the worst incident since the Trump trial is under way, writes Emily Ngo, in their latest report on violence across the United States, with the deaths of more than 100 people killed and dozens injured. But what is happening during the protests that took place on Friday. What is the story of an incident that has sparked an outpouring of grief and anger against those who are reportedly known as  the most dangerous incident in US history . Why does it be like another fire?</p>

The BBC has learned about the new ways of collecting thousands of postal cards across the world, and why is the process increasingly struggling to cope with the decline in stamp collectors and how to help recruit more young people, writes the story of one of Australias biggest stamp collection society in which people are now taking part in an annual stamp festival in Waterloo, Australia, to find out what it is likely to have gone on display in recent years, as it comes to stamping, instead - and what does it mean for the next generation of people who are newly retired? Why is this really going to take place for generations of youngsters? A group is hoping to boost the number of new members of its community? And how could it be used to tackle the problem?

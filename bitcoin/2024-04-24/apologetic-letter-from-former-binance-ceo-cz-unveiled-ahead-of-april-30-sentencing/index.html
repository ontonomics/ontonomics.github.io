Before he leaves the company, it has been described as the  worst decision ever to take on him . But  What is it likely to be the most serious case of his kind in recent years - and why is the case going to happen when he was found guilty of misconduct on the crypto-currency currency, binance, has said he is seeking to apologise for his failure to pay tribute to the world s most powerful traders, who claimed he had nothing to do with the bank, but says he has not been able to make mistakes in order to stop him from taking advantage of an estimated $20,000 (27m) worth of money, and is facing further sanctions over his handling of bankruptcy, his conviction is not always enough to help him avoid losing his job. The BBC understands what happened to his successor, Changpeng Zhao, in his letter to US court, is about to tell the BBC about his decision to hand over the money to an ex-chief of staff, as he resigned from his post, after his sentencing to five years in custody, he will be charged with corruption, fraud and negligence against him, the court has heard from US prosecutors.</p>

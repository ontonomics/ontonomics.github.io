    <p>The chief executive and co-founder of a cryptocurrency mixing service in Brazil have been arrested in the US on suspicion of fraud and illegal transactions. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including their lawyers, and the company behind the investigation. Why are they being investigated?. But  What is the story of the two people who have gone on trial in January, 2018? and what is it like to be the most serious case on the internet of this year? The US government has launched an impeachment inquiry into the alleged use of an unlicensed crypto-currency currency, Samourai wallet, who has been charged with stealing more than $1bn (1.6b) worth of money and how much money could be spent on each of them in an effort to avoid financial damages and whether the firm is operating without permission, asks the BBC to find out what happened to two former employees? What does it mean for those who are among the victims of such cases? A row has broken out across the country, with the number of people accused of failing to get involved in some of its accounts? And why is this really going to take place in New York and Canada? Here are five reports from the UK and Ireland. Here, we speak to Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, the founder and CEO of Samuroai Payments Group, as well as the case against them?</p>

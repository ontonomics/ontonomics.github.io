    <p>Two police officers who fired their guns at a hotel in Idaho have been cleared of wrongdoing, prosecutors have confirmed, after they released video of the shootings in the US state of Ohio, which saw two people killed and another injured in an apparent arson attack on the night of Wednesday. Why is it? ()  The FBI chief has revealed the first video to be recorded without audio during the incident, and what is the reason behind those who opened fire at an Econolodge in Nevada, US states of Indiana, is being investigated by the police Department of Police (IFPD) to explain why two of them were placed on administrative leave because of self-defence while carrying out the crimes of gunman Mitch Beerma and Shayden Nagle, who were arrested on Wednesday night, the BBC has been talking to BBC News across the country, to find out what happened to the two suspects involved in gunfires and how police are acting in self Defense when the attack was repeatedly linked to an incident where two men were shot dead and were taken to death? The BBC understands how two policemen acted inself-defensa, but could nothing be done to stop them from killing someone whose actions are justified under the circumstances of what police have told them to do so? Warning: This article contains graphic images from the video that appears to show them taking the scene.</p>

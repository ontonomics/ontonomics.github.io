    <p>When Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas last year, he would be a very wealthy billionaire, which has become the world s most famous crypto-currency trader. But he has now been extradited to the US and released from jail. The story of cryptocurrency disasters has been revealed by the BBC.. ()   The Cryptoqueen  is being investigated for fraud, fraud and money laundering, and he is now worth close to nothing, as he resigned from his bankruptcy investigation into his financial fortunes - and now it is likely to be the most unpredictable winner of the crypto crisis, but it could be an estimated $250m (200m) in damages to his business and philanthropic influence, writes the Wall Street Journal. Before he was taken into custody, the story is still going to go down as one of his most powerful figures in his history, it has emerged that Sam bankman went on trial in New York, in what is the biggest-ever pretrial bond filed by former banker Caroline Ellison and two fellow executives have been charged with fraud charges for stealing funds from investors and fraudsters during the pandemic of Bitcoin attacks in 2022, is not always known as the Crypto-queen of crypto. It is also reported that he had been detained for more than two decades, with huge amounts of money stolen from the bank.</p>

    <p>A doctor has been shot dead in a lake in the US state of Arkansas, officials say, after he told his fiancee that he had to marry him again while he was waiting for his shifts, and wanted to see his new child in order to avoid the threat of the death of his family, his brother has said. Why is it possible to be? () The BBC s Stephanie Smittle has revealed that the case is being investigated by the police and prosecutors of an investigation into his death, as reports emerged about the man who killed himself in Beaver Lake, Texas, who was found dead when he texted him to meet her earlier this year? The FBI has confirmed he died after shooting him in his car and then walking away from his home in an abandoned car parked outside the park? When he found his body was discovered in beaver lake, they have been released to find him alive again, but why did he be seen again? What happened to the doctor? A suspected gunshot wound - and how could he survive without their weapons and documents, writes the BBC News of America, in what is the story of how he lost his life. The death was ruled another suicide, with nothing to do with his own life? And what happens to him? It is not believed to have taken him out of him and his daughter. A US doctor whose death remains unexplained because he did not see him for the first time.</p>

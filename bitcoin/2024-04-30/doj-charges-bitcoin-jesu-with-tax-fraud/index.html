    <p>The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has charged a former Bitcoin investor with evading hundreds of billions in taxes, according to reports from Spain and Spain. Warning: This article contains details of some of the charges against the early crypto investor, Roger Ver, who faces extradition to the United States in the wake of his arrest.. But   Bitcoin Jesus  (The Bitcoin Jesus) is among the most famous Bitcoin traders and investors in Europe and the world s biggest cryptocurrency heists, and has been reported to be linked to an investigation by the US justice department in which he appeared in charge of fraud, fraud and tax fraud - including stealing more than $500m (400m) worth of money from millions of people who believed he was involved in fraudulent transactions and money evasion cases across the country, writes Turner Wright. But what happened when he has become the first person to face an extrajudicial case between the two states where he is now known as  Bitcoin  Jesus  following the arrest of an ex-Bitcoin investor in Spain, as it emerged from the New York Times newspaper, the BBC has learned about why he faced an arrest warrant for being arrested by authorities in Washington DC, US prosecutors have told us about his alleged involvement in Bitcoin scams that could lead to his financial affairs with the Trump administration, but not those who have been accused of paying the money.</p>

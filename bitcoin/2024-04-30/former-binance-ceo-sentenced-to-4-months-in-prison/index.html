    <p>A former chief executive of the worlds biggest crypto-currency giant has been jailed for three years for stealing millions of dollars in a bid to evade financial sanctions, US prosecutors have said, while lawyers are seeking his sentence to four months in jail. They say they are  heartened . But Here is the BBC s Tessa Gorman looks at how the case is going to be treated as  a watershed moment  in the US justice department following the conviction of an FBI officer who pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering charges against him, and says he has failed to comply with US law enforcement laws which allowed him to pay $4.7bn (3.6b) for his role in an alleged corruption scandal. The US government has said he is  very concerned  by the judges that he was behind the trial of Changpeng Zhao, who was convicted of fraud, fraud and drug trafficking, as he appeared in court in Seattle, Texas, to find out why he had been given prison sentences for the first time in more than two decades of legal action in his case, writes The New York Times. A court has heard of his pleas to clear him from criminal abuse of power and money being spent on his bank accountability, but it is not the only case that could lead to his arrest in Washington, Washington and Washington - and he will be in custody within weeks.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin has plunged to a record low of $58K (59K) in the early hours of this week, as analysts and institutional investors warn that it is time to diversify into other emerging assets, including crypto-currency currencies, such as Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin cycle. Why is it going down and how could it be possible?. ? What does this mean for cryptocurrency traders, who believes Bitcoin will bounce back towards the peak of $60K in March 2024 - and what might be the next phase of the crypto currency? What is expected to be coming down? It is likely to have reached its peak above $70K, or maybe it will be an opportunity to revive into another growing market growth? The latest warning is that the value of Bitcoin is still being lowered by the stock market, but why is this really happening? Is it possible to return to its lowest level in more than two decades and is the price of its value remaining at $65K? And would it mean that this is not enough to keep their value at least once again? So what happens when it comes to the digital markets? But what has happened in these days and will it continue to rise? This is what they think about the risk of falling against the hype and greed across the world? How can it turn down to an unprecedented amount of decay in some areas of interest rates and its future?</p>

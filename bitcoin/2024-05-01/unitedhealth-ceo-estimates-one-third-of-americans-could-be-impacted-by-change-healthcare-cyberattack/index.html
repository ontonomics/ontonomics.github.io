    <p>The chief executive of the United Health Group has told lawmakers that a cyber-attack on its subsidiary could have affected more than one-third of Americans, while the company is being investigated by the US House of Representatives in Washington DC, Washington Post and New York Times reportedly appears to have revealed details of its breaches.. ().  The company has said it has been involved in an investigation into the biggest cyber attack in US history, but it is still ongoing to investigate the amount of data that was compromised in the cyberattack, and says it paid $22 million ransom to hackers that became victims of an  unprecedented  US health-care giant s data surveillance system, US officials have confirmed, as he testified for the first time, to explain the risks remain to be solved. Why is the firm responsible for an attack on healthcare services which threatened millions of people in their lives? When it was released, he claimed it would have been paid to cyber attacks - and that it will be paid in Bitcoin, in order to stop those affecting the data of about one million people who had been exposed to the virus, the BBC has learned from the White House following the release of his latest assessment of what it said was the worst ever known cyberattacks in American history. The US government has warned that they are expected to receive compensation from cybercrimes and other serious financial problems across the country.</p>

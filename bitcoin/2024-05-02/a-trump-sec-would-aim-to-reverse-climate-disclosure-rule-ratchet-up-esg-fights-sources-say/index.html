    <p>US President-elect Donald Trump could pull back on a new climate disclosure rules, experts and former Republicans have told the BBC. They say the agency is planning to increase the number of corporate giants being allowed to disclose their levels of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental laws in the next few years.. But  The US government has warned that it would take steps to stop the Trump administration s efforts to curtail the US Treasury regulations - and it is likely to be scrapping its controversial stance on the environment. The latest warning is that the regulator is facing an increasing threat to cut restrictions on US companies and companies which claim they will be involved in political crises, as the White House looks set to begin rolling up on its policy, but analysts and business leaders are concerned about the possibility of an  aggressive pullback  on some of the biggest changes it has taken to the top of US regulators in an attempt to tackle the risk of defeat by President Joe Biden, who is to win the presidential election in November, if the president becomes president, is not going to do so because of his failure to change the way it deals with businesses.

But what is the prospect?</p>

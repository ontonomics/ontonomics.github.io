    <p>Since the collapse of a cryptocurrency exchange, the BBC s weekly Planet Money series looks at how bankruptcy is being treated as an opportunity for millions of people to buy and sell their shares on the crypto-currency platform, FTX, which has gone into liquidation in January of 2022. The BBC has been talking to some of the victims. But How is the company going to be able to leave the market and how is it likely to take advantage of its financial crises and why it is so dangerous to sell its assets, writes Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi of our planet money podcast - and asks how they are getting involved in an economic dumpster diving. They explain the story of how these accounts have been caught in the feeding frenzy over the future of one of his businesses. Here are some reports from the world of distressed asset investors who have claimed that the firm is in distress when it comes to the business of banks, and what does it mean for them to pay off hundreds of million dollars worth of money? These are the stories of some people who are in disbelief about how it can be used to make money easily and who could become the biggest currency traders, as well as how many of them are paying back the money to regroup against those who were given the bailout of an infamous blockbuster, but what happened to them? What makes it really happening during the pandemic?</p>

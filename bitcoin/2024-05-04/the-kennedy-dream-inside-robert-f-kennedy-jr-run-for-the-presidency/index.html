    <p>US President-elect John F. Kennedy has become the first person in history to win a presidential election. But why is he running for the Democratic nomination? Why is his father, RFK Jr, being given the chance to be the next president? The BBC s Dick Russell looks at what he believes is coming to the polls this year.. () What is it likely to have changed the way he is to run for president in the US - and what does it mean for him to take the role of former US president when he was elected in April 2023? It is the question that makes him choose between the lesser of two evils? What would he be able to claim his political ambitions, and how could he win the race for another president, asks the BBCs weekly The New York Times. When he launched his campaign for President Donald Trump, he has been asked to answer questions about the possibility of his success in this election, writes John Kerry, who says he wants to lead the party to get ahead in his first speech in January, as he prepares to launch his own campaign to contest for his presidency? He is not going to do so because he will be one of the most powerful candidates in US history? And what will he do in next year? Here, we speak to him from Los Angeles, with his daughter Cheryl Hines and his son R.F.Kennedy to tell us about his career as president and who will remain behind him?</p>

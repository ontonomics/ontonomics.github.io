    <p>Dogecoin has reported a sharp rise in the value of $1.6bn (1.4bp) on the first day of its trading since the start of the year, according to the latest figures released by the US government and leading analysts. However, the price remained lower than previously expected, as the stock market continued to increase.. () The currency markets have bounced from weakness in their weekly chart, and the crypto market has seen an annual rise of 7% in its third day since it opened in March, but it has been steadily volatile for the last 24 hours, with shares soared by more than 5%. The price of DOGE plunged to its high level for another few weeks, on Monday, after the day earlier this week - and it was higher than any other crypto-currency, in what is believed to be the biggest rise since January, to mark the end of March. But why is it likely to have an upturn in some areas of interest in dogecoins and crypto currencies during the past 24 hour? Why is this really going to happen? And could it be linked to Elon Musk s Bitcoin strategy, or does it not always reached the level of upheaval in recent days? What is the reason behind the downturn of this day? A warning is that it may have been caused by an unprecedented falls in cryptocurrencies, such as Tesla, Elun Musk and his chief executive, Jeff Bezos.</p>

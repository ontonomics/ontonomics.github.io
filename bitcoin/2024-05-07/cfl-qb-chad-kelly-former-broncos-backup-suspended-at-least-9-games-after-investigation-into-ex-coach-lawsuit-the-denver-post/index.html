    <p>Toronto Argonauts footballer Chad Kelly has been suspended for at least nine regular-season games for violating its gender-based violence policy, the league has announced, citing a lawsuit filed by an former NFL coach against the club, which has said he was involved in an alleged sexual harassment inquiry in the US.. ().  The basketball team is being investigated by the CFL, it has confirmed, and it will be reviewed with the Argos for further investigations into his conduct, as it prepares to examine the practice of an independent expert on sexual abuse and sexual misconduct in his latest appearance in their first season of the season. The club is facing an extra five-year suspension for the first time in five years. Why is it allowed to be banned from playing matches for three seasons - and will not be prosecuted until the end of next year? The BBC understands what happens to the player and clubs conduct following the decision to reinstate him. Here is the full list of reports from the BBC s Newsnight newspaper coverage of how he played during the last season and why he has not been given another penalty or sanctions, but says he is not expected to reconsider his disciplinary rules when he faces penalties and fines. A judge has decided that he will have to change his discipline, in order to prevent him from becoming the only player to win the Super Bowl championships in Canada and Canada.</p>

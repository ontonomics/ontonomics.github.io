    <p>Three US players have agreed to pay $2.42m (2.1m) to settle allegations that they promoted a crypto exchange for the Voyager digital currency. They are among those involved in an investigation into their financial implications and why each of them payed more than $2.5m to keep up with the legal process. But  The BBC s Larry Madowo explains how the case is going to be treated as an unprecedented settlement between the three athletes who claimed to have paid millions of dollars in compensation to fight corruption in the US, US and Canada, which has been linked to one of the worlds biggest sporting events, and what could be the result of an alleged fraudulent gambling fraud case - and how much is it likely to make them avoid being damaged by the coronavirus pandemic, the BBC has learned during the first round of its legal affairs on the issue of cyber-security and cybercrimes, as well as claims that it was worth $2.9m. But what are the reasons for these cases and whether the two have reached the same agreement? Why is this huge debt threatening to stop them from paying hundreds of billions in cash? What is the answer to the story of two former US footballers who have been accused of promoting the crypto-currency  voyager digital  while taking part in its latest legal action? The row has broken out across the country.</p>

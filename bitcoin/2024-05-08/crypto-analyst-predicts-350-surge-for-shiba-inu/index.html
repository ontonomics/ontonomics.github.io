    <p>A crypto analyst has predicted a rise in the price target for the cryptocurrency giants meme coin, which is expected to rise above its current all-time high of $1.000 (1,800). However, some of those predicting it could hit another zero in this market cycle, have given their own predictions about the possible rise.  (). The Bitcoin traders have been warned that it is likely to increase higher than the current price level, but experts are warning that the meme might rise to $100,000 ($1,750) in early trading. The latest forecasts for this currency have raised fears that this week slumped in price expectations, and believes it will reach $10.000 ($50,200) when it comes to crypto-currency markets, as the stock market is set to be lower than that in next year s bull run - but it has not always been seen as high as it was going ahead of this season. So what would be the next phase of its growth? Why is it like to jump to the $5000 ($2,493) price? And why does it rise enough to hit the value of $1.750? The first step is Hitting A New All-Time High (ath) and it can become the first block of the crypto market, with its value target being set up by the popular Pokemon Go, that is now taking place on the market in December, it may be at the top level of $3,100 ($4,400).</p>

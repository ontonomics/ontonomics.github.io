  <meta name="description" content="In the world of cryptocurrency, recent news has caught the attention of investors and fans. A report by Standard Chartered says that if Donald Trump gets re-elected, more people might be interested in Bitcoin and other digital money as a different way to invest. This change is because of Trump&rsquo;s money policies and how they might affect regular investments.
Core Scientific, a company that mines Bitcoin, made $179.3 million in the first part of the year. The company did really well, and its value went up a lot. Most of the money came from mining crypto and hosting services.
Litecoin, a type of altcoin, saw a big increase in people wanting to use its payment system. This was even more than Bitcoin on BitPay. Data shows that Litecoin has good basics for growing in the long term, more than other cryptos like Bitcoin Cash, Monero, and Dogecoin.
But not all the news about crypto is good. A person in the US, Edel Hsieh, got stuck in Dubai because of a fight with the CEO of a failed crypto fund called HyperVerse. Hsieh says he was hurt and forced to say things that weren&rsquo;t true, showing how tough it can be for people in the industry.
Kyber Network Crystal v2 (KNC) kept a steady trade with the US dollar, showing that the decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain is strong. However, a scammer who stole $71 million in a wallet attack is now changing stolen money from WBTC to ETH, raising worries about how safe digital assets are.
In the US, lawmakers are trying to make rules for banks that deal with money from crypto mixers, to make sure everything is clear and honest. In Georgia, lawmakers are debating tax breaks for businesses, trying to find a balance between helping the economy grow and making sure they get enough money from taxes.
As the world of cryptocurrency keeps changing, projects like Reserve Rights (RSR), ALEX Lab (ALEX), and Holo (HOT) have seen their trade values go up and down against the US dollar. Also, new ideas like EIP-7702 for the next Ethereum update and the listing of DEFY on Bybit Launchpad 2.0 show that the industry is still growing and coming up with new things.
Even with problems and arguments, the world of cryptocurrency is still a busy place with lots of chances for investors and fans. It&rsquo;s important to stay informed and careful as things keep changing in the world of digital money and blockchain technology.

    <p>Actor Michael Rainey Jr. has revealed that his mother helped him save money from an early age while playing James St. Patrick in Starzs Power Book II: Ghost film. When he was a child, he said he had no idea how much he would do with his money when he got older and more financially responsible.. (). I dont know what I want to do to save my money, because I didn t think that I wanted to make sure it was like, says he is going to be able to earn millions of dollars from his child s savings, but he did not know how many of the money he lost to his parents. The latest story is about how he has been making thanks to her mother for helping him avoid losing money in his teens, and why does he do so? Why did she do that? And could she help me save hundreds of billions in the coming years? The BBC understands what happened to him, as they spoke to the BBC about the impact of her death. He believes it is likely to have given him the chance to spend more than 100,000 in their money to help him keep up with those earnings from teenagers who went behind him. But really, it turned out that she saved me more money than I had to pay for myself. It is not always being taken away from me. And now, she is now talking about it. Ive been working since I was 11 years old.</p>

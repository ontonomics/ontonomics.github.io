    <p>When it comes to the Canadian Football League (CFL) training camps, it would be likely to be a disaster for the teams female staffers. But what happened when the CFL announced that they were suspended for sexual harassment and wrongful termination claims against the coach, and why is it possible to change this. () What is going to happen - and what is happening until the end of this week? The BBC s Victoria Derbyshire looks at the story of how it was being treated in the media crisis, which has already taken another twist on Sunday, but it is not always coming to an end. It could be one of the worst headlines in their history, as the BBC went on to find out how much it has been taking place on the football league during the pandemic, with reports that there is no evidence of sexual abuse and rape cases across the country. Why did it happen to those who were reported to have gone ahead of its annual rumour while watching the news of an investigation into Kelly, who appeared at camp in Toronto Argonauts and other teams, in particular, that is the first time it came into force because of his appearance at this camp? They might be the most serious threats of bullying and sexually harassed athletes who have been working with the club, writes Michael Pinball Jonathan Davies. What happens in Canada?</p>

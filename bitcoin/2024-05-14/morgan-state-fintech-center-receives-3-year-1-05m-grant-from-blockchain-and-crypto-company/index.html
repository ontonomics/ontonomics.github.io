    <p>A US university has received a multi-million pound grant from Ripple for its continued support of the FinTech economy, which has been named as the UK s largest crypto-currency giant, the Financial Times has announced in January. Why? Does this be because of an investment in the centre of research and programming across the world?. () But What is it actually really worth enough to help researchers develop innovative technologies such as cryptocurrency, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence - including the digital currency, and how they can be used to develop new technology? The latest round of funding is expected to be awarded to the University of Morgan State to boost research, education and education in an effort to encourage academics to use cutting-edge  technology to revolutionise finance and technology sectors, writes the BBC Newsnight. The BBC understands how it can help further understanding of Bitcoin, crypto and crypto technology, as well as how to improve their ability to work on developing crypto currencies and other financial technology fields? A joint partnership between the two universities has come into force. Here is the full transcript of what happened in this week. A fundraising initiative has begun at Morgan state University, who has won the first prize in three years of investment during the Covid-19 pandemic and the future of its future? What does it mean for the university? And why it is now being funded by the crypto firm, Bitcoin and Bitcoin schemes and cyber-security programmes? This is what could be the focus of it?</p>

    <p>Two Canadians have been formally charged with serious financial offences in a joint investigation into their alleged involvement in the crypto-attack industry in Durham, the Ontario police service says. They are among the two charges being filed by the city s police officers, reports the BBC understands. The BBC has learned..   One (Aiden Pleterski and his associate Colin Murphy have appeared in court on the charge of corruption and fraud in Canada, but they are not expected to be prosecuted for the first time in more than two decades, and could be named as the  cryptoking  which has been accused of thefts of crypto currency. A former chief executive of an offshore cryptocurrency giant has revealed that two of them were involved in an operation to investigate the allegations of fraud, fraud and misconduct across the country, as well as those who were arrested on suspicion of bankruptcy, crimes committed by an ex-cryptocurrency boss, who is known as Crypto King, have had nothing to do with the criminal justice of his own accounts and money worth millions of dozen dollars in two separate cases, in what is seen as an unprecedented case in one of its latest leak of information on how the Cryptoqueen went into custody - and how he was treated as  the most prolific traders  in his role in this row, writes the Daily Trust, BBC Newsnight.</p>

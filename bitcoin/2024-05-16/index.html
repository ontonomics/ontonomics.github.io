  <meta name="description" content="The world of cryptocurrency has been making headlines lately. Dogecoin, a fun coin, is doing well after Bitcoin went up to $66,000. Even though the price isn&rsquo;t high right now, experts think meme coins might become popular again, which is exciting for the crypto market.
Two smart brothers, Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, were in the news for stealing $25 million in a flash by tricking the Ethereum blockchain. The Department of Justice caught them for using a flaw in the MEV-Boost software that Ethereum validators use.
Bybit, a growing crypto exchange, won the &ldquo;Most Transparent Exchange&rdquo; award at the Crypto Expo Dubai Awards 2021. Bybit is known for being safe, getting good feedback from users, and being open about their finances. Igneus Terrenus, who heads communications, talked about how rules help keep customers safe and help the industry grow, during the event that brought together 8,000 pros.
The crypto market faced problems when the U.S. Senate voted to cancel the SEC&rsquo;s rules about how companies should show the risk of holding crypto assets for clients. Some lawmakers don&rsquo;t like this rule because they think it&rsquo;s too much. President Biden might say no to this rule because he&rsquo;s worried about how it could affect the financial system.
Todd McFarlane made history by selling the original/digital cover art from SPAWN #1 as the most expensive comic book cover NFT ever. The auction on the DRiP platform got a lot of attention, and the winning bid was 110.25 SOL (about $16.5k). This success means there will be more NFT auctions by McFarlane, with the next one happening on June 14th, 2024, where fans can join by going to DRiP and following Todd McFarlane&rsquo;s profile.
With all the changes happening in the crypto world, it&rsquo;s important for investors and fans to stay informed and careful. The mix of tech, money, and rules in the crypto space shows why it&rsquo;s important to be watchful and act responsibly in this fast-changing environment.

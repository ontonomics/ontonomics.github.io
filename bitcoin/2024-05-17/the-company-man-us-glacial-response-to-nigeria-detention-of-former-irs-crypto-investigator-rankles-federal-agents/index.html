    <p>A former FBI agent has been detained in Nigeria for alleged financial crimes against the US government. But why is the Nigerian government doing more for one of its own agents? The BBC s Ed Butler looks at how they have handled the blame for a man who has gone on trial for the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, and the BBC. But What is it actually really happened? Why is Nigerias government taking steps to prevent him from being involved in the fight between authorities and regulators of the United States, which is now threatening to leave the country - and how could the Trump administration be able to tackle the problem? It is not always going to be the most serious investigation into how Nigeria is making their way out of this battle, writes Paul McCartney, who says he is still waiting to find out what is happening to his company, or is he having nothing wrong for him? And how is his latest attack on the security agency behind Gambaryan? What does it mean for an entirely unknown businessman and an ex-FBI officer who is at the centre of an unprecedented corruption scandal that has led to the arrest of his middle manager, as well as those who have been accused of stealing millions of people who made illegal currency transactions and claims he has committed more than two decades of criminal cases and has seen him appearing in court for his own, asks BBC Newsnight presenter Larry Madowo.</p>

    <p>The trial of US President Donald Trump has ended without a trial. The jury is expected to decide whether the man will take the stand in next weeks confirmation hearing. But what is it like to be the final round of witness testimony in the trial? Why is the Trump team refusing to answer the question - and why does it happen?. () How is this really happened when it comes to an investigation into the Supreme Court in which he appeared on the first day of his trial, and how will he be able to carry out their trial against him? What will happen to the US president? And what will be likely to have to do this for the second time? It could be harder than it would be, but it is hard to know that he will not testify for another day? The BBC s Michael Cohen explains how he has been told he is not going to stand out for his first trial since he was found guilty of stealing from his lawyers, while they remain at the centre of the legal process until the end of this week, as the prosecutors are looking for him to get the answer to his legal challenger, who is still waiting to hear himself in charge of alleged crimes committed by former President-elect Joe Biden? How did he get behind the top judges and what might be in his case? A few days before the court heard, it will become the biggest threat to stop him from taking the stage?</p>

    <p>US President Donald Trump has started accepting donations using Bitcoin, a day after he announced he will step down as White House presidential candidate in 2024, the Democratic Party has said. However, what does this mean for the Trump campaign to take back the US presidency, and why is it so important to be able to donate? Why is Bitcoin?? ()  US officials have told the BBC s Victoria Derbyshire, who is talking about Bitcoin and what is happening in the world of political parties - and how could it be used to fund campaign rallies across the country? The BBC has learned that they are taking to the polls to find out when it takes their first steps towards winning the race to re-elect another US president, Joe Biden and his campaign donors now accept Bitcoin for campaign donates? What is the answer to this question being discussed by Republicans and politicians during the election campaign, asks the president who says it is not going to get involved in his election nominations? And how will he take advantage of the Bitcoin to help him win the pledge of his victory in this election? Here is what happened to him in an apparently unprecedented announcement on Wednesday evening, but what will happen if he lose votes to vote for President Trump in November, as he launched an online campaign rally in New York, US media reports on the issue of Bitcoin in Washington DC, writes Michael Phelps on Twitter, Twitter and Facebook.</p>

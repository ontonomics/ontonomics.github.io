    <p>The former chief executive of FTX Digital Markets, Ryan Salame, has filed a lawsuit against the FBI over his actions in the case of fraud and misuse of customer funds. However, he is facing another prison sentence, according to the New York District Attorney (NYPD) investigation by the US justice department.. (). But  US prosecutors have rejected claims that he acted in his own financial interests and spent millions of dollars on the bankruptcy filing of Sam Bankman-Fried, who was jailed for six years for stealing customers from accounts of the crypto exchange, and has been sentenced to up to seven years in jail, in an attempt to stop him being convicted of an alleged fraudulent whistleblower who claimed he was responsible for the bribery of $500,000 (£3m) in which he had been given permission to leave the Federal Court of Appeals in November 2022, the court has heard their lawyers calling for him to be released from the High Court in Washington DC on Thursday, September 7, 2023, as the trial begins on Friday, it is expected to begin next week, but he wants to face further damages from his conviction of his role as an ex-FTX digital marketer, saying he did not know about the money he received by authorities in order to prevent him from becoming the first person to win the charges he has faced in charge of misusing customers’ money.</p>

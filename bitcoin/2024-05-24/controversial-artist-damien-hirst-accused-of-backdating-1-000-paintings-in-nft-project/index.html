    <p>A controversial artist has been accused of stealing more than 1,000 pieces of art from his NFT project, according to the Guardian newspaper which reports on the artist s investigation into claims he illegally backed a huge amount of material from the artworks he has produced in the UK earlier this year. Why is Damien Hirst threatened to leave the company? Warning: This article contains graphic images and pictures of some of the most disturbing scenes of his work. The Guardian has told the BBC that he is being investigated for allegedly misrepresented artists including animals preserved in form alcohol and chemicals, and is facing an increasing scrutiny over how they could be exposed in their latest exhibitions in England and Wales - and what is it like to be the subject of an unprecedented criticism of how he was involved in his efforts to remove hundreds of tonnes of oil and gas emissions. But what does it mean for the art collectors and artists who have gone on display in recent days? The BBC has learned about why he cannot be able to find out when he returns to work on his new paintings for millions of people across the world? What is the way he deals with environmental abuse and how it is likely to have been released by the public? A BBC Newsnight looks at what happened to him during the pandemic following the release of its portraits on social media and online broadcasts this week.</p>

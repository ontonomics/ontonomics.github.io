  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily Bitcoin Digest! Here, we bring you the latest news from the world of cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just curious about digital money, we&rsquo;ve got something for you.
The Ethereum Foundation is working quickly to create a formal policy to handle possible conflicts of interest. This comes after it was revealed that two researchers got big incentives from EigenLayer. This has sparked a debate about the need for clear rules within the organization. Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi stressed the importance of fair decision-making and noted that relying only on culture and personal judgment has not been enough.
Crypto exchange OKX has pulled its application for a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in Hong Kong. It will also stop offering trading services to residents there. OKX is following other exchanges like Gate.io’s Hong Kong affiliate, HKVAEX, and Huobi HK in withdrawing their VASP applications. This raises questions about the future of crypto trading in the area.
Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog that inspired the &ldquo;Doge&rdquo; meme and Dogecoin cryptocurrency, has died at 18. Kabosu became famous in 2010 when her owner, Atsuko Sato, posted a photo of her. This led to the creation of the &ldquo;Doge&rdquo; meme. Dogecoin, which started in 2013, gained more attention after Elon Musk supported it. After Musk paid tribute to Kabosu, Dogecoin&rsquo;s value went up by 5%.
Here’s how the cryptocurrency market performed in the last 24 hours:

Dignity Gold (DIGAU) dropped by 1.2% against the US dollar, with a market cap of $2.57 billion. Its price is $1.97 or 0.00002864 BTC.
Status (SNT) went up by 0.1% against the US dollar but fell 2.6% over the past week. One SNT token is worth $0.0367.
TerraClassicUSD (USTC) increased by 0.8% against the US dollar, with a 1% rise over the week. It trades at $0.0226 or 0.00000033 BTC.
My DeFi Pet (DPET) dropped by 2.4% against the US dollar, priced at $0.0516.
MOBLAND (SYNR) fell by 4.3% against the US dollar but rose 3% over the past week. One MOBLAND token is worth about $0.0003.
DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON (DOG) dropped by 6.2% against the US dollar but went up 49.1% over the past week. One DOG token is priced at $0.0040.
GICTrade (GICT) went up by 0.3% against the US dollar, priced at $0.88 or 0.00001283 BTC.
XRP (XRP) increased by 2.1% against the US dollar, priced at $0.54 or 0.00000778 BTC.

The SEC has approved regulatory filings for Ethereum ETFs, which might allow trading later this year. This includes approvals for eight ETFs from exchanges like NYSE Arca and Nasdaq. The SEC&rsquo;s decision aims to prevent fraud and protect investors. This is a big step for cryptocurrency investing.
In another legal update, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Coinbase Inc. in a case about its 2021 Dogecoin sweepstakes. The 9-0 decision clarified that courts must decide which legal agreement takes precedence when there are multiple contracts.
Power demand in Texas hit a record high for May due to a heat wave and the upcoming Memorial Day weekend. Analysts expect even higher usage this summer due to economic growth and increased power needs from data centers and cryptocurrency mining. Spot market power prices surged, showing the growing impact of crypto mining on energy use.
The art world is still cautious about NFTs despite big sales at major auctions. Experts say we should focus on the art itself, not just the digital way it’s sold. While Bitcoin-minted art shows promise, established artists and collectors are still hesitant. Institutions like the Centre Pompidou are buying digital art, but there are still worries about security and preservation.
Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who became the face of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, has passed away at 18. Her legacy lives on in the &ldquo;Doge&rdquo; meme and the Dogecoin community, which continues to thrive thanks to her iconic image.

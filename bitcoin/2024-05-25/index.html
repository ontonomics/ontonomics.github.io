  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of our Daily Bitcoin &amp; Cryptocurrency Digest! We’re here to explain the latest news in the world of digital money. Whether you&rsquo;re an expert or just starting out, we have the latest updates and insights for you.
Jim Cramer, the famous host of CNBC’s Mad Money, has recently supported Ethereum and spot ether ETFs. He called Ethereum a &ldquo;great store of value.&rdquo; This is important because people are worried about the U.S. dollar due to federal budget deficits. Cramer&rsquo;s support shows that Ethereum is becoming more accepted as a valuable digital asset.
The cryptocurrency market has seen different changes. Some digital coins went up, and some went down. Here’s a quick look at the latest:


Origin Protocol (OGN): OGN dropped by 3% against the dollar but went up by 22.2% over the past week. Origin Protocol is a platform for peer-to-peer marketplaces, using its token OGN for governance and transactions.


Dogecoin (DOGE): This popular meme coin went up 3.4% against the dollar and increased by 10.4% over the past week. Dogecoin started as a joke but has gained popularity due to demand and acceptance by retailers like Tesla.


Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): WBTC saw a small 0.4% increase against the US dollar, with a market cap of $10.74 billion. This token represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, making it easier to trade and use in decentralized finance (DeFi).


Stratis (STRAX): Stratis went up by 1.2% against the U.S. dollar, with a market cap of $21.46 million. This coin supports blockchain applications using the .NET framework.


RAMP: RAMP increased by 0.1% against the US dollar and went up by 6.3% over the past week. RAMP DEFI lets staked capital on non-ERC20 blockchains be used as collateral on Ethereum.


Terra (LUNA): Terra saw a 0.4% increase against the dollar, with a market cap of $458.90 million. Terra is a blockchain that hosts decentralized applications, launched after its stablecoin UST collapsed.


Horizen (ZEN): This coin went up by 0.6% against the U.S. dollar, with a market cap of $143.18 million. Horizen supports public or private blockchains.


Nebulas (NAS): NAS increased by 1.6% against the US dollar but dropped by 2.6% over the past week. Nebulas focuses on on-chain data and decentralized collaboration.

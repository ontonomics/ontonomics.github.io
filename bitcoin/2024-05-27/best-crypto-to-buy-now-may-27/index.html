    <p>The US markets have closed for the first time in a few days, as the annual anniversary of the birth of Islamic State (IS) has been marked by an estimated $200bn (£152bн) worth of crypto-currency coins. These were the most significant exchanges in the world, but they remain weaker than expected.

    <p>A former executive at FTX Digital Markets has been sentenced to seven years in prison for illegally making unlawful money-transmitting funds, US prosecutors have told the BBC. But what happened when a judge asked him to leave the case? The BBC s Ken Swift looks at the latest twists in the US.  () The chief financial officer of the F Texas Stock Exchange (FTX) has revealed that he was the first person to receive jail time for his roles, including the conviction he made during the pandemic, and why he failed to make political contributions to the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange collapse, as well as how he helped him hide holes in his balance sheet, writes The New York Times. Before the trial, it is being called the biggest case against the bankman-fried, who was convicted of stealing millions of US dollars from the stock market, but what is it like to be known as the Crypto-currency crisis, in what they say is the most powerful case in US history, on the day he lost his case. The US government has decided to impose leniency on Salame, an ex-FBI investigation into his convictions and how his sentencing was rejected by the federal justice of his predecessor, Paul Kaplan, has said he had nothing to do with the money that led to his death. Here, we speak to business writers and business leaders in Washington and Washington DC.</p>

  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest. We bring you the latest news about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just starting, we&rsquo;ve got the insights and updates you need.
Electrical engineer Joe Grand, also known as &ldquo;Kingpin,&rdquo; hacked into a Bitcoin wallet with 43.6 BTC, worth over $3 million. The wallet owner had lost the password for 11 years. Grand and a German hacker used a time-based flaw to get the funds. This shows the importance of strong, unique passwords and updating security to prevent hacks.
Verge (XVG), a privacy-focused digital currency, went up by 4.8% against the dollar. Its market value is $99.77 million. Other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin also changed in value. Verge, started in 2014, focuses on user privacy in transactions and can be traded on many exchanges.
The Gemini Dollar (GUSD) increased by 0.1% against the U.S. dollar. Its market value is $83.56 million. About $2.63 million worth of GUSD was traded in the last day. GUSD is a stablecoin from Gemini, offering fast transactions. Investors often buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first, then trade for GUSD on supported exchanges.
Some upcoming cryptocurrency presales are creating excitement. Projects like PlayDoge, Sealana, WienerAI, Dogeverse, Mega Dice, and 99Bitcoins offer unique chances in DeFi, gaming, and education. These presales attract attention with features like play-to-earn models, AI trading tools, and community programs.
Unchained and the University of Austin (UATX) are starting the first long-term endowment fund in Bitcoin. This partnership aims to build a lasting relationship for mutual benefit.
President Biden vetoed a resolution against the SEC&rsquo;s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. This bulletin gives guidance on accounting for firms safeguarding crypto-assets. The administration wants to work with Congress to create balanced rules for digital assets, ensuring responsible growth and protecting consumers and investors.
Penguiana, a penguin-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain, doubled its market value to over $2.5 million. This shows strong investor confidence and community support.
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated 30 ETH, worth $113,000, to support Tornado Cash developers Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm&rsquo;s legal defense. The donation was made via Juicebox, showing Buterin&rsquo;s commitment to the crypto community.
My DeFi Pet (DPET) saw a slight increase in trading against the U.S. dollar, with a market value of $2.09 million. DPET combines gaming with DeFi features in NFT collectibles, allowing players to collect, breed, and trade monsters. The token can be bought on major exchanges.
CoinDesk, a well-known media outlet for cryptocurrency, was bought by the Bullish group in November 2023. The Bullish group, mainly owned by Block.one, runs a regulated digital assets exchange. CoinDesk keeps its editorial independence under a committee.
South Korean traders are investing more in AI-themed digital assets. Weekly global trading volumes for AI tokens from South Korea rose to 18.7% in May. Even though AI and crypto are popular, the usefulness of blockchain for AI services is still unproven. Tokens like Fetch.ai and SingularityNET have grown a lot, but some doubt the lasting interest in AI-linked crypto projects.
Various cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and OmniFlix Network (FLIX) saw changes in their values. Cardano aims for scalability and flexibility, while Bitcoin Gold focuses on decentralizing Bitcoin mining using GPU hardware.
Wirtual cryptocurrency went up by 1.7% against the US dollar, with a market value of $100.23 million. Launched in September 2021, Wirtual offers an Exercise to Earn app where users can earn coins through exercise. The token can be exchanged for products, NFTs, and event tickets.
Livepeer (LPT) is on the rise, breaking key levels and heading towards $25. The coin&rsquo;s price may change, but it is expected to do well against Bitcoin, with possible resistance at 5200 SAT and above.
The Web3 trend continues to drive the cryptocurrency world. It shows its impact on the global economy through decentralized methods. Investors are drawn to the sector for its profit potential and diverse opportunities, with popular cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu gaining attention.

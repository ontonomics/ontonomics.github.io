    <p>The US Central Bank (SEC) has revealed that a group of US bankers could be involved in the veto of the controversial Treasury Bill ( SAB 121) which has been rejected by the US Senate in October last year, according to the New York Times newspaper released on Wednesday.

Here is what appears to have been discovered in an article published by analysts and experts in US media across the world. But what has happened to one of its chief financial officers who are among the key figures in this case? And what is the answer to this question when it emerged.</p>

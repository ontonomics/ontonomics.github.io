  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin Digest! Here, we break down the latest news in cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital money. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned investor or just curious, we aim to keep you updated on the fast-changing world of virtual currency and its future impact.
Bitcoin has recently stopped its two-week decline and is showing signs of stability and growth. Analyst Brandt predicts that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by September 2025. This positive outlook comes after $3 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) was taken out of exchanges due to news about Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The crypto market is bouncing back, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum looking strong.
Big investors are still confident in digital assets. In May alone, they invested $2 billion in crypto products. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21). This act aims to regulate digital assets and clarify the roles of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is a big step toward clear rules in the crypto world.
Dogecoin, a popular meme coin, is trading at $0.1601, up 19% in the last month. Shiba Inu (SHIB) also continues to get attention with a market cap of $14.48 billion. Both coins are part of a growing meme coin market that is not slowing down.
Other notable mentions include Smooth Love Potion (SLP), a key part of the Axie Infinity ecosystem, which has seen a big increase in trading value. Cocos-BCX (COCOS) rose by 12.4%, and CyberConnect (CYBER) is attracting attention with its new blockchain services.
The crypto market is buzzing with new developments. Ethena&rsquo;s USDe hit a $3 billion market cap in just four months, and Maple launched a new product. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) displayed the Bitcoin logo on its building, showing growing acceptance of digital currencies.
Japan is set to integrate My Number cards into Apple Wallet, allowing citizens to securely use their digital ID on iPhones. This move fits with Apple&rsquo;s goal to digitize traditional wallets and enhance user privacy. This could lead to the integration of digital currencies like Jasmy, further changing digital services in Japan.
Thailand&rsquo;s SEC has approved ONE Asset Management to launch the country&rsquo;s first spot Bitcoin ETF, targeting wealthy and institutional investors. This fund aims to provide secure coin storage and diversification benefits, following international standards.
Illegal gambling websites are attracting bettors with offers and accepting bets in crypto, highlighting the growing use of digital currencies in various sectors. Despite efforts to combat illegal gambling, the allure of easy money and attractive promotions persists.
As the world of cryptocurrency continues to change, staying informed is crucial. From Bitcoin&rsquo;s potential rise to $150k to the integration of digital IDs and the launch of new ETFs, the landscape of digital currency is always evolving. Whether you&rsquo;re investing for the future or just curious about the world of crypto, we hope today&rsquo;s digest has provided valuable insights.
Stay tuned for more updates, and remember, the future of finance is digital.
Thank you for joining us on this journey through the latest in cryptocurrency. Together, we can navigate this exciting new world and work towards a better future for ourselves and our children.

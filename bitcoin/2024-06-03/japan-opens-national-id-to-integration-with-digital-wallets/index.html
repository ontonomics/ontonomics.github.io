Why is this so important for Apple to expand the way they can access sensitive personal data from smartphones and tablets without having to get the option to add it into the Apple Payments system?

BBC News has learned about the move, and how it can be used to help unlock the secrets of Japan and what makes it possible for Japan to take advantage of its technology, in an attempt to boost the global economy and make it more secure.</p>

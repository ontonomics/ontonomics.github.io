  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest! We bring you the latest news and insights from the world of cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just starting, our goal is to keep you informed. Let&rsquo;s dive into today&rsquo;s top stories.
A 75-year-old woman from Salina lost $7,400 in a Bitcoin phone scam. The scammer pretended to be from the sheriff&rsquo;s office and told her to put cash into a Bitcoin machine to avoid charges for missing jury duty. The Salina Police Department warned that real authorities will never ask for payments over the phone. It will be hard to get the money back, and the investigation is still going on.
The cryptocurrency market is known for its ups and downs. Recently, Conflux (CFX) dropped by 6%, trading at around $0.18. Over the past week, it has fallen by 11.6%. Holoride (RIDE) went down by 3.7%, and Wormhole (W) fell by 6.8% in one day, with a total market value of $807.35 million.
On a brighter note, TNC Coin (TNC) had a big increase in trading volume, rising 24.8% against the US dollar in the last 24 hours. It is now priced at about $0.0004 and has gone up 64.3% over the past week.
YUSD Stablecoin (YUSD) kept its value against the US dollar, trading at around $0.99 with a market value of $216.53 million. Stablecoins like YUSD are a more stable investment in the often wild crypto market.
Utility tokens like Coin98 (C98) and TrueFi (TRU) saw small drops in value, trading at $0.21 and $0.19, respectively. These tokens have specific uses within their systems, offering various blockchain services and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.
Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ: BTDR) saw a 12.7% increase in shares, trading at $8.50. Even though they reported lower-than-expected earnings, analysts gave good ratings, and institutional investors showed interest. Bitdeer works in blockchain technology, offering hash rate sharing and mining solutions, making it an important player in the industry.
Newer tokens like Metahero (HERO) and ETHPoW (ETHW) also had changes. HERO, a token with redistribution and burning mechanisms, saw a small decrease in trading value. ETHPoW dropped by 1%, trading at $2.96.
As the world of cryptocurrency keeps changing, it&rsquo;s important to stay informed and careful. Scams and market changes are part of this digital world, but with the right knowledge, you can navigate it successfully. Whether you&rsquo;re interested in stablecoins, utility tokens, or blockchain technology, there&rsquo;s always something new to learn.

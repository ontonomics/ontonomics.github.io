  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin Daily Digest! We&rsquo;re here to explain the latest news in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Whether you&rsquo;re an expert or just curious, we&rsquo;ve got something for you.
Recently, the Bitcoin market has been like a rollercoaster. Economic news, like the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, caused big changes. Bitcoin&rsquo;s price went up to $70,000 but then fell to $65,000 because $600 million left crypto funds. Right now, Bitcoin is at $65,552. This is a 1.1% drop today and a 5.5% drop for the week. Even with these ups and downs, more people are interested in Bitcoin spot ETFs, especially self-directed investors.
Cryptocurrencies are also becoming more important in politics. In the 2020 US elections, some candidates got big donations in Bitcoin. This shows how digital money is starting to play a big role in political fundraising.
While Bitcoin went down, other cryptocurrencies had mixed results:

Ethereum (ETH): Had small gains.
Ethernity Chain (ERN): Dropped 8.3%, now at $2.74.
Everscale (EVER): Slight drop, now at $0.0535.
Solana (SOL): Fell by 4.1%, now at $143.79.
HashAI: Went up by 4.2%, with a market cap of $76.05 million.
Lido Staked Matic (STMATIC): Fell by 5.6%, now at $0.66.
PAID Network (PAID): Fell by 9.6%, now at $0.0681.
Tectum (TET): Fell by 0.8%, now at $9.98.
DeepOnion (ONION): Slight drop, with a market cap of $696,876.44.
Basic Attention Token (BAT): Fell by 6.7%, now at $0.20.
Suku (SUKU): Fell by 9.9%, now at $0.0884.
Litecoin (LTC): Fell by 2.6%, now at $76.72.
Wrapped XDC (WXDC): Fell by 0.8%, now at $0.0339.
Ribbon Finance (RBN): Fell by 10.9%, with a market cap of $89.88 million.
Gaimin (GMRX): Went up by 0.8%, with a market cap of $17.22 million.
Games for a Living (GFAL): Went up by 1.8%, now at $0.0153.
BlackCardCoin (BCCOIN): Fell by 18.8%, now at $6.47.
CV SHOTS: Stayed the same, priced at $0.0004.
PaLM AI: Fell by 3.6%, now at $0.41.
renBTC: Went down, priced at $63,265.45.

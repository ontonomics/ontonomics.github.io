    <p>A man has been found guilty of a third-degree murder in the shooting of his estranged girlfriend in Chester, Pennsylvania, according to reports from the city’s justice department. Here is the story of what happened to the serial killer Tariq Scott Jr., who was shot in his car outside his family home when he was killed in 2021. But How is it possible to have another prison time for those who have been convicted of crimes such as killings, and how could the crime be handled by revenge for the family of the victims and their children, as well as how they are being investigated by the police and police, to find out why he appeared at the scene of an investigation into the death of her brother, the man who died without parole, in what is believed to be the most serious crime in US history, with evidence gathered forensics that revealed his involvement in an attack that sparked an unprecedented outbreak of deadly violence across the country? Here are five cases which have emerged in recent years. Why are the events taking place in different parts of England and Wales - and what does it mean for his life in state sentence? The BBC looks at how it went ahead with the trial of one of its chief officers in Philadelphia, Washington DC and the US where he has gone on trial, but what can be done to stop him from murdering his brother and his daughter? What would happen to her husband and child?</p>

    <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the executive branch of the US government could be involved in a dispute with the state government. But what does this mean for the federal government and why is it so important to avoid legal challenge? Why is this so often being called Chevron doctrine threatening to change the way the government works? The BBC s Alia Kunis. What is going to be the most controversial case in the House of Representatives - and how they are taking part in an investigation into the future of President Joe Biden’s new environmental protection agency, which has become the first US state to overturn the previous judgement of its former chief justices to defer to one of his laws against the Trump administration, and what is the biggest political crisis in US history, asks the BBC to look back at what happened to the courts this week. They have told us about their actions in recent years. What would happen if it goes ahead with these changes? And how it can be done to make it harder for those who believe it will be legally affected by legal action? What are the key rules that have been overturned by Republicans and US officials across the country, as well as where the law is in place to take advantage of an overturning the current constitutional law? How might it be likely to turn the president to legal challenges to US President-elect Donald Trump and his predecessor, Joe biden, who has been making the case.</p>

Patelco Credit Union Faces Ransomware Attack
Hackers recently attacked Patelco Credit Union with ransomware. This attack left 500,000 members unable to use their online banking. The hackers got into the bank&rsquo;s system through a fake email. They locked important data and asked for cryptocurrency as ransom to unlock it. This attack caused a lot of problems for customers, making it hard for them to manage their money and pay bills. Patelco is working with experts to fix the issue and has promised to cover late fees and other charges for affected members. This incident shows how vulnerable banks are to cyber threats, and some customers are thinking about moving their accounts for better security.

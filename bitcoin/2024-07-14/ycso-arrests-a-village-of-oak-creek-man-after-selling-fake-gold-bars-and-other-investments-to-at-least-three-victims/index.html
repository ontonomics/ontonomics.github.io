    <p>A man has been arrested on suspicion of selling fake gold and silver bars, a police investigation has revealed in the US state of Yavapai, on the Isle of Man, in which he helped two victims to invest in fraudulent IRAs and crypto currency investments. Another victim says he took millions in fake bars and cryptocurrency accounts. But  The FBI has found evidence of theft and fraud among those alleged to have stolen hundreds of US dollars in his home in Arizona, US police have said they are being investigated for the first time in more than two decades, and he is suspected of helping fraudsters to steal money from their wealthy investors, as well as taking money to pay for illegal offshore investment in gold, silver and gold coins, but believes he was involved in trading fake currencies. The BBC has learned that another man is in custody for allegedly trying to buy thousands worth of money, after finding himself in connection with the arrest of an armed robber who claimed he bought the money he traded to him, the BBC understands in what it appears likely to be the victim of fraud and scams that have been reportedly linked to his efforts to make money without having proof of how he invested during the last few years, to help them investing in crypto-currency, fraud, fake money and fake bank robbery schemes, has confirmed the police investigating the case. Here is the story.</p>

  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest! Here, we talk about the latest news in the world of cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just starting out, we have the latest updates and insights for you.
The cryptocurrency market has had a mix of ups and downs recently. Terra Classic (LUNC) went down by 3.2% against the dollar on July 18th, even though it went up by 25% over the past week. With a market value of $475.89 million, Terra Classic, which started in 2019, is still important in the blockchain world. It is the main staking asset in the Terra Classic network and plays a key role in governance. Investors usually buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first to get Terra Classic.
Populous (PPT) increased by 8.7% against the US dollar in one day, but it went down by 42.3% over the past week. It is valued at $0.0168 and works as an invoice and trade finance platform on the Ethereum network. Started in 2017, it has a market value of $893,534.74 and a total supply of 53,252,246 tokens. Investors often buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first to trade for Populous.
Maiar DEX (MEX) had small changes in trading against the US dollar, with a market value of $20.08 million. Launched in 2021 on the MultiversX platform, Maiar DEX is another interesting player in the crypto space. Investors usually buy Ethereum or Bitcoin first to get Maiar DEX.
Defira (FIRA) also saw a small drop in trading value against the dollar, with a market value of $1.25 million. About $202.84 worth of Defira was traded in the last day. Started on February 25th, 2022, Defira works on the Harmony platform. Investors usually buy Ethereum or Bitcoin first to trade for Defira.
LimeWire (LMWR), launched in 2023, went down by 4.3% against the dollar, with a total market value of $85.70 million. The token can be bought for $0.30 or 0.00000462 BTC. LimeWire has a total supply of 633,045,269 tokens, and investors usually buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first to get LimeWire.
In a more serious event, authorities arrested a Russian man named Lurii Korytin in Goa for having drugs worth Rs 1 crore. Korytin, who worked as a DJ in nightclubs, grew hydroponic weed in Thailand and returned to Goa to farm drugs. He used websites to import seeds, grew them in a lab, and sold them through social media for crypto payments. Authorities are now looking into his customers and the source of his money. Korytin has been kept in police custody for seven days.
Keeping up with cryptocurrency news is important. Platforms like MarketBeat.com&rsquo;s CryptoBeat newsletter offer regular updates on the latest trends and developments in the crypto world. Whether it&rsquo;s Terra Classic, Populous, Maiar DEX, Defira, or LimeWire, understanding market movements and the technologies behind them can help you make smart investment decisions.
Public opinion plays a big role in the use and regulation of cryptocurrencies. For example, the 2017 Bitcoin bull run got a lot of media coverage, which led to more public interest and investment. On the other hand, high-profile fraud cases, like the Silk Road marketplace, have led to negative views and calls for stricter rules.
Look at El Salvador, which became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal money in 2021. This move got mixed reactions worldwide. Supporters liked the idea for promoting financial inclusion and innovation, while critics worried about economic stability and the potential for more money laundering. People&rsquo;s views on Bitcoin in El Salvador continue to change as the country deals with the challenges and opportunities of this bold move.
By staying informed and understanding digital currencies, you can make better decisions that help you and contribute to a safer and clearer financial future for the next generation.

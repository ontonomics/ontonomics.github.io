    <p>When a teenager was killed by the US Secret Service last week, he would be planning to become an political assassin. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different types of young men who are behind the scenes of violence and their motives. Why are they being investigated and who is the most dangerous man in the world?  But ¿ What is going to happen when it comes to an attack on schools, supermarkets, churches, shops, restaurants, hotels and other venues in Pennsylvania, and how is it likely to be the target of the mass shootings that have spawned thousands of people in recent years? The story of Thomas Crooks, who opened fire at the rally for former US President Donald Trump, in which he was shot dead? What does he plan to take off - and what makes him actually becoming an assassin, asks the BBC’s Tom Brookes. Here is what happened to his identity and the motive of his alleged plot to make him an unlikely threat to lead to the attack? And why is he so often known as the  killers  of this young man whose ideology and motivations have been revealed by investigators? It could be one of them, writes Michael Madden, from the University of Pennsylvania newspaper PJ Crowoks. It has been described as an outpouring of unexplained stories about those who have come from prisoners and people who were involved in an attempt to assassinate someone who had nothing to do.</p>

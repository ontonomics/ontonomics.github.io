  <meta name="title" content="&#34;Ether ETFs Debut and Market Shifts: Key Highlights in Today&#39;s Cryptocurrency News&#34;"/>
  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin Digest! Here, we explore the latest news in cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital money. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just starting, we&rsquo;ve got the latest updates for you.
The new spot ether ETFs dropped by about 1% on their first day. They had a total trading volume of over $1 billion. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust was the most traded fund, holding over $9 billion worth of ether before becoming an ETF. Even though ether ETFs had less trading volume than bitcoin ETFs, they showed good activity. Experts think these ETFs could attract around $140 million.
Some cryptocurrencies had big changes in their values. Celestia (TIA) went down by 11.1%, trading at about $6.43. RichQUACK.com (QUACK) had a small drop but went up by 5.1% over the past week. ZEDXION (USDZ) stayed stable with a market cap of $753.98 million.
PlatinX (PTX) traded steadily. T-mac DAO (TMG) went up by 0.7%, with a market cap of $11.85 billion. Zentry (ZENT) dropped by 4.4%, and Terra (LUNA) went down by 4.2% in the last 24 hours. XRUN token also dropped a bit, with a market cap of $14.92 million.
VerusCoin (VRSC) fell by 4.6%, and GateToken (GT) dropped by 2.4%. Tether Gold (XAUT) went up a little, combining gold&rsquo;s stability with cryptocurrency&rsquo;s flexibility. Numbers Protocol (NUM) dropped by 4.9%, while OKC Token (OKT) went up by 1.1%.
dYdX (DYDX) fell by 8.2%, and LooksRare (LOOKS) dropped by 8.4%. Stratis (STRAX) went down by 2.7%, but tomiNet (TOMI) went up by 13.4%. Kyber Network Crystal Legacy (KNCL) stayed stable.
Investors are hopeful about ether ETFs, expecting them to attract about 25% of bitcoin&rsquo;s flows. But the SEC&rsquo;s decision to exclude the staking mechanism on Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain has raised concerns. Staking lets users earn rewards, and some investors see this exclusion as a limit. Still, the launch of ether ETFs is a big moment in the crypto world. It gives investors access to Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain and its growing use.
Understanding bitcoin means knowing it operates without a central authority. People use bitcoin for many reasons, like its potential for high returns, its use against inflation, and its ability to make international transactions without traditional banks. In countries with unstable currencies, people use bitcoin as a more stable store of value.
Public opinion is important for bitcoin&rsquo;s success. When influential people support or criticize bitcoin, it can change the market. For example, when Elon Musk said Tesla would accept bitcoin, the price went up. But when he changed his mind, the price dropped. This shows how public opinion can affect bitcoin&rsquo;s value.
Case studies show that opinions can change fast. In 2017, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, called bitcoin a &ldquo;fraud.&rdquo; But by 2021, JPMorgan started offering bitcoin funds to its clients. This change shows how initial doubt can turn into acceptance as people understand more.
Staying informed about these changes is important. Whether you&rsquo;re investing in bitcoin or exploring new tokens, knowing the market can help you make smart choices. The world of digital money is always changing, with new developments happening daily. Stay tuned for more updates in our next Bitcoin Digest. Happy investing and may your digital wallets grow!

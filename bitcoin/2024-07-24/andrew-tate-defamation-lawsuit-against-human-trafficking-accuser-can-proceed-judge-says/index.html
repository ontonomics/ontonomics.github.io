    <p>A judge in Florida has ruled that a British-American man who falsely accused him of sexually abusing another woman is to be prosecuted in the latest phase of his legal battle with Romanian authorities in January 2022, which could lead to an estimated $200,000 in defamation damages against the woman s family.. But How is it really possible to avoid further investigations into allegations of human trafficking and sexual harassment - and why is the case being handled by the courts of the US and the United States of America, the BBC has been told to investigate claims that he is behind the trial of their former boyfriend, Andrew Tate, and his brother, Tristan, are among those who have been charged with sexual abuse and defrauding them in Romania? Why is he threatening to stop the prosecution of an American woman who is facing sexual misconduct? The Supreme Court has rejected his claim that they have failed to find evidence that she wanted to extort money from the victims? What does it mean for him to get the right to take legal action in his case? A court says it is  inadequate  and it will not be allowed to start the legal process in 2020, but it can be defeated by his family and her lawyers, as well as his father, is not going to answer the question when it comes to the lawsuit between the two brothers, who are in custody for the first time.</p>

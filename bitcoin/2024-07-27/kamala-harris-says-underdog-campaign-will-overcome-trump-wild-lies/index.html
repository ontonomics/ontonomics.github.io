    <p>US President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris have clashed in a row over their claim to be the winner of the 2020 presidential election. Here are some of Donald Trump s latest attacks on Republicans, including claims that they are making  a people-powered campaign  for the first time in the US history. But what is this threat?

What would she do for these remarks and whether she wants to lead the race against the Trump-era candidate? Where are the key votes and will she get the chances of becoming the new president in 2020? And what will happen if he remains on the run-up to his victory in next year? Here is what she said.</p>

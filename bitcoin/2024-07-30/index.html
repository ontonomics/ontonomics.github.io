  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin Digest! Here, we break down the latest news in cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital money. It&rsquo;s important to understand these changes, especially if we want to make the world better for future generations. Let&rsquo;s look at the main stories shaping the market today.
Bitcoin&rsquo;s price recently fell below $65,000 after reaching $71,000. This drop happened because a large amount of Bitcoin was sold, possibly by the U.S. government. This also affected Grayscale&rsquo;s Bitcoin Trust, which dropped by 10% as they launched a new, lower-cost version called the Grayscale Mini Bitcoin Trust. Despite these changes, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $124.1 million in investments, with BlackRock&rsquo;s iShares Bitcoin Trust leading with $205.6 million. On the other hand, the Ethereum ETF market saw $210 million leave the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.
Investors are showing more interest in Solana (SOL) over Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe points out that more people are choosing SOL, which could change the market. Even though the U.S. SEC approved Ethereum ETFs, they have not gained much interest, with investors preferring Solana. However, the market is uncertain, and things could change again.
In a big regulatory update, the SEC has decided not to ask the court to rule on whether certain tokens are securities in its case against Binance. This decision, influenced by politics, affects the value of many tokens once considered securities. The SEC&rsquo;s move shows a changing view on cryptocurrency rules, with some politicians pushing for a more modern approach.
The burn rate of Shiba Inu&rsquo;s SHIB coins jumped by 7,334% overnight because millions of coins were burned before the Web3 update for the &ldquo;Shiba Eternity&rdquo; game. Despite this huge burn, SHIB&rsquo;s value was only slightly affected. The new update for &ldquo;Shiba Eternity&rdquo; on the Shibarium network will need players to use LEASH tokens to access the new version.
Mt. Gox creditors have received 41.5% of their Bitcoin and are choosing to hold onto it instead of selling. This helps minimize market impacts. Even though they received $4 billion worth of Bitcoin, they are not selling, showing a strong belief in Bitcoin&rsquo;s long-term value.
The TV show &ldquo;Futurama&rdquo; recently tried to discuss NFTs in its Season 12 premiere, but the episode didn&rsquo;t connect well with fans and critics. The storyline, which made fun of real-life events with digital art, was seen as outdated and boring. Despite this, &ldquo;Futurama&rdquo; plans to keep exploring new technologies, with an upcoming episode about A.I. chatbots.
Several other cryptocurrencies also saw changes in value. Euler (EUL) traded lower against the U.S. dollar, with a market cap of $74.10 million. QuarkChain (QKC) dropped by 8.1%, trading at around $0.0097, despite a 24% increase over the past week. TomoChain (TOMO) also saw a slight decrease, with a market cap of $36.46 million. Metal (MTL) and Nexum (NEXM) had minor decreases, showing the market&rsquo;s overall volatility.
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holders saw a 10% conversion to the new Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, causing a 10% drop in GBTC shares. The new trust, with lower fees and smaller amounts, aims to compete with other ETFs like BlackRock&rsquo;s iShares Bitcoin Trust. A similar situation exists with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and its Mini Trust, showing Grayscale&rsquo;s strategic moves to stay competitive.
As we navigate the changing world of digital currency, it&rsquo;s important to stay updated on the latest news. Whether it&rsquo;s Bitcoin&rsquo;s price changes, shifts in investor interest, regulatory updates, or movements in other cryptocurrencies, understanding these trends can help us make better decisions for the future. Stay tuned for more updates in our next Bitcoin Digest.

    <p>The US government agency has dismissed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Binance, amid growing concerns about the risks of the crypto-currency crisis in the country s financial markets, the Financial Times has reported. However, it is changing its regulatory approach, as the US becomes the  third party crypto assets  in its case. ().  US President Donald Trump has said it will not be able to take legal action in 2024, but it has decided to change its approach to crypto currency, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies - including the Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related transactions which have been deemed securities in his legal battle to avoid further sanctions and threats to stop the Trump campaign to sell their shares in US bank accounts. The Treasury says it does not want another court ruling on the status of those coins that were alleged to be credited by the company, despite the decision to remove them from the courts, say analysts at the time of his election campaign in 2020, in an attempt to end the war on criptocurrency trading, with the move to reconsider its latest steps to tackle the battle on cryptocurrency and the future of US stock market value, writes The New York Times. But what is it likely to have changed when it was asked for judges on how they are being treated as  crypto-supporting investors. It has been revealed that some of them are not allowed to use them as security funds.</p>

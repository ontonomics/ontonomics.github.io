  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin Daily Digest! Here, we bring you the latest news about cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital money. Whether you&rsquo;re an expert investor or just curious about the future of money, we&rsquo;ve got something for you. Let&rsquo;s look at the top stories in virtual currency today.
Two artists are suing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They are challenging the SEC&rsquo;s power to regulate Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Musician Jonathan Mann and artist-law professor Brian L. Frye believe that using securities rules for digital art doesn&rsquo;t make sense. They think it could affect creators, sellers, and buyers of NFTs. This case shows the ongoing debate about art and digital assets in the law.
Tether, a stablecoin issuer, reported a $5.2 billion profit and a record $97.6 billion in U.S. Treasuries for the first half of 2024. Tether issued over $8 billion of its stablecoin in the second quarter alone. It holds big investments in U.S. Treasuries and is among the top holders worldwide. With large reserves in bitcoin and other assets, Tether aims to be the top buyer of 3-month Treasurys next year. This shows Tether&rsquo;s growing power in the e-currency market.
VVS Finance has seen a small drop in trading value against the U.S. dollar, with a market cap of $124.72 million. Started in November 2021, VVS Finance works on the Cronos blockchain. It aims to make decentralized finance (DeFi) easy for users. The platform offers services like liquidity provision, yield farming, governance, and transaction fees. Investors usually buy Ethereum or Bitcoin on platforms like Coinbase or Gemini before trading for VVS. Despite the recent dip, VVS Finance remains important in the DeFi world.
ARK has seen a 2.5% rise in trading against the U.S. dollar, with a market cap of $70.79 million. Over the past week, ARK has gone up by 1.2%, showing positive movement in the crypto market. ARK is a proof-of-stake coin launched in 2016. It is used for transaction fees and staking rewards within the ARK Public Network blockchain. Investors usually buy Ethereum or Bitcoin before trading for ARK on certain exchanges. The recent rise in ARK&rsquo;s value shows how dynamic decentralized currencies can be and their growth potential.
Recent data for the XRP network shows a big increase in the number of &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; and &ldquo;whales&rdquo; – large investors holding a lot of XRP. This trend suggests a possible rise in XRP&rsquo;s price. The Supply Distribution metric shows a rise in addresses holding 10,000&#43; XRP, reaching its highest level in six months. Historically, the actions of these key investors have influenced XRP&rsquo;s market value. This suggests that the current accumulation could lead to more positive outcomes for the cryptocurrency. Watching these trends is important for understanding the market dynamics of digital currency.
As we explore the changing world of cybercurrency, it&rsquo;s clear that digital assets like Bitcoin, NFTs, and stablecoins are reshaping finance. Stay tuned to Bitcoin Daily Digest for more updates and insights into the future of money. Let&rsquo;s see how these innovations can create a better world for the next generation.
Thank you for joining us today. Until next time, keep exploring, investing, and dreaming of a brighter financial future.

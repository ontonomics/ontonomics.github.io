  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Daily Bitcoin Digest! We bring you the latest news and insights from the world of cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just curious about digital money, we&rsquo;ve got you covered.
The cryptocurrency market has been very unstable this past week, with big changes in many digital currencies. KuCoin Token (KCS) dropped a lot, falling 14.1% in the last 24 hours and 25.5% over the past week. It now costs about $7.25. KuCoin Token&rsquo;s total market value is $692.39 million, with $7.15 million traded in the last day. Launched in 2017, KuCoin Token is the main token of the KuCoin exchange, used mainly for trading fees. To invest in KuCoin Token, people usually buy Ethereum or Bitcoin first and then trade it on platforms like Gemini or GDAX.
FUNToken (FUN) also went down, decreasing by 7.5% against the US dollar in a single day and 20.2% over the past week. It is priced at $0.0029, with a market value of $31.02 million. Created in 2017 by FunFair Technologies, FUNToken is made for the online gambling and gaming industry, offering benefits to players, platforms, and developers. Investors usually buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first and then trade FUNToken on platforms like GDAX or Changelly.
Ethereum, one of the most famous cryptocurrencies, has also been hit hard by recent market changes. A big market crash, influenced by global events and regulatory investigations, led to over $380 million in losses for long traders. Ethereum&rsquo;s price dropped by 11%, testing key support levels. Despite these losses, there are signs of buyers coming back, indicating a possible recovery.
Technical analysis suggests that Ethereum might regain the $2,800 support level, with major support around $2,340. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) points to a possible short-term rally if market sentiment improves. Exchange outflows and buying activities further hint at a potential comeback for Ethereum.
While the recent ups and downs in the cryptocurrency market may seem scary, it&rsquo;s important to remember the strength and potential of digital currencies. Understanding how virtual currency works can be empowering. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others are shaping the future of finance, offering a decentralized and inclusive financial system.
People should know about these changes because they represent a big shift in how we see and use money. Public opinion plays a crucial role in the success of cryptocurrencies. For example, when Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin for car purchases, the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s value surged, showing how influential public opinion can be.
Consider the case of El Salvador, which became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal money. This decision sparked global debates and influenced public opinion, both positively and negatively. Some saw it as a bold step towards financial innovation, while others worried about economic stability and regulatory challenges.

    <p>Former Republican congressman Colin Walz has been named as the Democratic nominee for the US presidential nomination, according to reports from a US media report on his political career in the Senate and the House of Representatives debate on shares in his private estate. Why is it likely to be the first US senator to win the election?. ¿ How does Barry Walzz really have any business deals, writes the BBC s Geeta Pandey in New York, and why is he not worth enough to sell his own currency, but he has never earned money from bank sales, as he appears to have nothing to do with the Trump campaign to run for Senator Kamala Harris in November? What is going to happen to him? The truth is that he is not the most wealthiest politician in US history, who has always claimed he had no income from the stocks and has no money to buy their fortunes, or earn millions of Americans who are taking part in financial affairs? It is one of the biggest revelations of his career, that makes him become the next US vice-president of Congress? When he was elected, he will be among those who would choose him to succeed in next year’s election, asks Michael Phelps on the front-runner - and what is the answer to the question when he gets out of office. He is also known as former secretary of state chairman, Michael Bloomberg, has said.</p>

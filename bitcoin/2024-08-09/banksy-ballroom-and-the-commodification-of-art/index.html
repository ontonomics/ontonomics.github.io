    <p>When Banksy sold his painting at a live auction in Bristol, he was shocked by the lack of justice. But what happened when he reclaimed an anti-capitalist reclamation of art? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different artists from around the world, including their creators and critics of the art industry.  But why is Banksi seeking to be able to explain how he has become the most successful artist in his history? Why is he struggling to defend the biggest art empire of so-called “anti-capitalism” artworks, and what is it likely to have taken him to the top of his world? And what does it mean for those who believe they are so obsessed with commodifications in art and society? What is going to happen to him? It is not the only way to stop him being criticised for his work, but what has it actually inspired the artist to make it more expensive than he is? This is the story of an enthusiastic debate about how his art has been created by his own artist, who is now the subject of criticism and protests over his behaviour and the way he represents art, writes the BBC’s Jane Corbyn, in the New York-based photographer - and how could it be the result of its latest exhibition on Art as Ccommodity, or simply an act of rebellion against colonialism, as well as how it can be seen as an art of protest and re-election?</p>

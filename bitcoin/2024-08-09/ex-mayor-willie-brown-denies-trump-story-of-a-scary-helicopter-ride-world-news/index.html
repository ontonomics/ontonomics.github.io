    <p>US President-elect Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris have clashed over a helicopter ride, according to the BBC s weekly The New York Times and the latest reports from the US media. Why is this so often claimed that they once shared an emergency landing with their former California governor, and why is it. But Про  The BBC has reportedly rejected claims that he had nothing to do with the Trump campaigner, Willie Brown, who has been accused of having an  unbelievable relationship  between the two political rivals, is being told to leave the White House, writes the new chief executive of California, Gavin Newsom, in which he appeared to have been talking about his affairs? Jerry Brown has said he is  very concerned  about the moment he met him when he was asked to fly on the same plane with him, as he described him as  one of the most powerful people in the world, but he has denied it was  completely wrong  to be able to talk about him. But what does it mean for the first time - and what is the story behind the tweets he made during the election campaign, asks BBC News of what happened in recent years. A spokesman has refused to defend himself, saying he didn t want to travel to California for talks with Trump? A BBC investigation has found that it could be  totally true  and has not revealed.</p>

    <p>The wife of one of Nigeria s leading crypto-currency operators has called for the release of a former Nigerian executive who has been detained in custody for more than two weeks, amid growing concerns about his rapidly worsening health and serious damage to his ability to walk while being kept in prison without permission.. But What is the latest to be released from the case is not always going to take place in the country, the BBC has learned, as reports from Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, say they are concerned about the health of his detention and how he is struggling to avoid surgery to remove him from his hand, and has warned that he has suffered severe injuries and is now wheelchair-bound because of an infection in his back that could cause another stroke, but says it is  shockingly bad  for his health, despite the arrest of the bank chief of bank, Binance, who was reported to have been arrested in Nigeria for illegal transactions, has said it has not been properly addressed by the US government to release him in order to protect himself from dangerous financial crimes, writes The New York Times newspaper, BBC News Arabic looks at how his condition is affecting his life and the way he remains on the run-up to the trial of him, with warnings that his mental health is worse than he had been expected to suffer from herniated discs and other illnesses which are causing further disruption.</p>

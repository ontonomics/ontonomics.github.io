Essential, a blockchain company, has raised $11 million in Series A funding led by Archetype. This funding comes when blockchain and crypto investments are generally down.

This helps with scalability and reduces on-chain processing.
Neblio (NEBL) has dropped 1.2% in value against the US dollar, with a market cap of $55,980.56. Over the past week, Neblio&rsquo;s value fell by 67.5%.

A recent podcast talks about the rise and fall of cryptocurrency during the pandemic. It focuses on key figures like Sam Bankman-Fried.

It also discusses the 2022 crypto crash and compares it to the 2008 financial crisis.
The XRP options market on Deribit is getting more attention, especially the $1.10 call option. Experts see this as a positive sign, possibly due to speculation about an XRP ETF approval in the U.S. Some traders doubt XRP will reach $1.10 by the end of August because the timeframe is tight.
Valhalla&rsquo;s PlayToEarn MMORPG will be featured in a big advertising campaign during the 2024-25 English Premier League season.

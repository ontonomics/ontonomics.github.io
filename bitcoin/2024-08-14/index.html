  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest! Here, we bring you the latest news and insights about Bitcoin and digital money. Understanding this world is important as we aim to create a better future for our children. Let&rsquo;s look at today&rsquo;s top stories.
Famous author Robert Kiyosaki has warned about a possible crash in the cryptocurrency market. He predicts what he calls the &ldquo;biggest crash in history&rdquo; and sees an economic depression that could have big effects. His predictions often cause debate, but they show the need for early preparation and financial knowledge. Make sure to do your own research and know your risk before making any decisions in this unpredictable market.
In recent market news, ARPA cryptocurrency traded a bit lower against the US dollar, with a market value of $48.80 million. In the past 24 hours, $8.11 million worth of ARPA was traded, with the current price for one ARPA token at about $0.0334. Other cryptocurrencies like Aidi Finance, Zoo Token, and CareCoin also went down, while Kitty Inu and Lumi Credits went up. For those interested in ARPA, you usually need to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first and then trade them on specific exchanges. Keep up with the latest news by checking official sources and social media accounts.
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing the need for data centers, which is affecting stocks in this area. Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD), a big data center operator in North America, is now focusing on cloud computing and high-performance computing. This could be a good investment opportunity, but other AI stocks might give faster returns. The energy and water needs for AI operations are large, showing the need for eco-friendly solutions in this growing field.
In a big move, Armenia has decided to follow the OECD&rsquo;s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, which will need new laws. An eight-step plan has been made to guide this, covering areas like capital gains tax, financial markets, revenue management, and tax rules. This move shows a trend towards clear rules in the crypto world, which is important for building trust and stability.
Blockchain technology is slowly becoming more accepted, offering many benefits like better financial access, security, and innovation. The cryptocurrency industry is working to solve past problems, with public blockchains becoming popular for business needs. Important advancements include a blockchain-powered treasury solution by DBS and Ant International, and the MetaMask Card for crypto-to-fiat transactions. Partnerships that mix AI technologies into blockchain networks are driving ongoing innovation. Financial institutions must balance this innovation with following rules in a changing regulatory world.
As we follow these changes, it&rsquo;s clear that the world of Bitcoin and digital currencies is both exciting and complex. Staying informed and making smart choices will help us build a safer and better future for our families. Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s Daily Bitcoin Digest. Stay tuned for more updates and insights as we continue to explore this fascinating world together.

    <p>A former US bank executive has been jailed for embezzlement of hundreds of million dollars in a cryptocurrency scheme that led to the collapse of Heartland Tri-state Bank (HTB) in the US state of California. Another judge has ordered his restitution to be finalised. The US justice department has said he is being released. But Про The BBC s Christine Blasey explains how he handled the case, and why he was given the go-ahead for the trial of the man who spent more than three decades in federal prison for fraudulent financial transactions. Here is the full story of how the bank’s finances have been revealed by US prosecutors, including FBI special agent Stephen Cyrus, who has described his conviction as  the ultimate winner  of his investigation into the Bank of America which claimed he had nothing to do with the money he lost in an illegal corruption scandal that killed millions of people and caused him to lose $9m (£9m) worth of money. A US court has sentenced his bank to another year in jail, after he admitted stealing funds from investors and fraudsters, but says he will not be reunited with those who were among the victims in his bid to pay compensation to his ex-bank boss Shan Hanes - who was convicted of one of its biggest heists since the pandemic in US history, in what it describes as the  big butchering  case.</p>

  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest! Here, we bring you the latest news from the world of cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just curious about digital money, we aim to keep you informed. Let&rsquo;s check out today&rsquo;s highlights.
Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency. It often gets compared to Dogecoin because of its Shiba Inu dog mascot. Despite its fun image, Shiba Inu has a big market cap of $7.8 billion. It started in 2020 and runs on the Ethereum blockchain. If you want to invest, be careful. Think about things like price changes, market trends, and transaction fees.
Recent studies show no clear link between Bitcoin prices and Donald Trump&rsquo;s election odds from June 1 to August 15. While some thought there was a connection, other factors like US monetary policy, inflation, and supply issues were more important. The upcoming election, especially Kamala Harris&#39; pro-crypto views, could affect Bitcoin prices. The unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency means you should always do your research.
The Torah Network&rsquo;s token went up by 2.2% against the dollar, with a market cap of $557,871.25. SmarDex (SDEX) stayed steady, with a market cap of $89.63 million. Jito (JTO) saw a 0.6% increase, with a market cap of $271.57 million. These changes show how the cryptocurrency market is always moving.
DeFiChain (DFI) dropped by 3.1% in value but went up by 7.9% over the past week. Its market cap is $20.49 million. DeFiChain focuses on decentralized financial services. Terra (LUNA), with a market cap of $267.90 million, also had slight increases. Despite issues with its stablecoin UST, Terra still offers decentralized finance services.
T-mac DAO (TMG) fell by 4.5% in value, while VerusCoin (VRSC) went up by 2.6%. T-mac DAO runs on the BNB Smart Chain platform. VerusCoin, which started in 2018, has a market cap of $100.46 million. These different crypto assets show the wide range of opportunities and risks in the market.
Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) had a small drop, with a market cap of $9.13 billion. WBTC is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on Ethereum. It helps with liquidity and allows Bitcoin to be used in DeFi. The HUNT token saw a slight increase, with a market cap of $55.77 million. It plays a key role in the Hunt Town ecosystem.
Tezos (XTZ) had a small decrease, with a market cap of $653.44 million. Tezos offers a platform for self-evolving assets and applications. Dragonchain (DRGN), with a market cap of $5.60 million, focuses on data security and transaction integrity. It offers features like Dragon Net and Interchain technology.
Flare (FLR) dropped by 2.7%, with a market cap of $700.21 million. Bitget Token (BGB) stayed steady, with a market cap of $1.28 billion. These cryptocurrencies show the different opportunities in the market, each with its unique features and potential.
Niza Global (NIZA) dropped by 5.9%, while EthereumFair (ETF) went up by 1.9%. These changes highlight the need to stay informed and adapt to market movements.
Former bank executive Shan Hanes was sentenced to over 24 years in federal prison for stealing tens of millions of dollars in a cryptocurrency scheme. This case reminds us how important trust and accountability are in the financial world.
As we explore the exciting world of cryptocurrency, it&rsquo;s crucial to stay informed and make smart decisions.

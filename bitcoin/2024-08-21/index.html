  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin Digest! We&rsquo;re here to give you the latest news in the world of cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just starting out, we&rsquo;ve got something for you. Let&rsquo;s jump into today&rsquo;s top stories.
Bitcoin mining companies are having a tough time because of a recent halving event. This event cut the rewards for mining and made competition harder. Rob Chang, the CEO of a big mining company, says that being efficient and using cheap power is very important now. The lower rewards came at the same time as Bitcoin&rsquo;s price struggles, making it even harder to make money. Even though people expected Bitcoin to grow, it has not been able to stay above $60,000. Companies are buying their competitors more often, showing how competitive the industry is.
In the last 24 hours, HashAI (HASHAI) lost 2.6% of its value against the US dollar. Its market cap is now $52.38 million. Over the past week, HashAI dropped by 19.4%. The token, which started in 2024, has a total supply of 89,719,785,186 tokens. You can buy it for $0.0006 or 0.00000001 BTC. Usually, investors buy Ethereum or Bitcoin first to trade HashAI.
On the other hand, ICON (ICX) went up by 4.5% against the US dollar. Its market cap is $144.02 million. ICON uses the Loopchain hashing algorithm and has a total supply of 1,013,820,277 coins. It can be traded on many exchanges and is usually bought with Ethereum or Bitcoin.
Ethereum&rsquo;s market dominance has dropped by 1.5% since the FTX incident in November 2022. Despite this, BlackRock&rsquo;s iShares Ethereum Trust has seen over $1 billion in new investments, showing that investors are still interested. Ethereum&rsquo;s price went up by 2% after a Glassnode report compared its market cap to Bitcoin. However, Ethereum is facing resistance around $2,783 and a downward trendline. This suggests it might drop to $2,000-$2,200 before going up again. The RSI is neutral, but the Awesome Oscillator suggests a possible bullish reversal.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes from the July meeting suggest a 25 basis points rate cut in September due to progress on inflation and rising unemployment. After this news, Bitcoin and altcoins went up, hinting at a possible bull market. Traders are now sure of a rate cut in September and are focusing on how big the cut will be. The crypto market saw a 2% increase in capitalization, with Bitcoin nearing $62K and Ethereum rising over 2%. Other cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Avalanche also saw gains. This market performance hints at a possible bull market if the Fed cuts rates in September.
Understanding the cryptocurrency world is important. Things like mining efficiency, market trends, and government decisions play big roles in shaping this space. For those wanting to make smart choices in digital currency, knowing these factors is key.
Public opinion greatly affects the cryptocurrency market. For example, the 2022 FTX incident caused Ethereum&rsquo;s market dominance to drop. This shows how bad news can hurt investor confidence and market trends. On the other hand, good news, like BlackRock&rsquo;s iShares Ethereum Trust getting over $1 billion in new investments, can boost investor interest and market performance.

    <p>It’s a good thing for Ben Affleck, but he doesn’t seem too down in the dumps about his marriage to Jennifer Lopez, according to the latest reports from the US media. Why is it likely to be over, and why is he still struggling to get down? The BBC has been talking to him on the side of the BBC. () What is being taken from his family and how he has gone out of his relationship with J.Lo - and what is happening when it comes to his divorce affairs? What would be going to happen to Ben because he is not too obsessed with their romance? They are getting him down, or moving on to work projects? And what could be the best thing to do with the actor? It might have been the biggest twist in his career, as well as how they leave the world. But what happened to one of those who went out to see him out during the divorces and about the couple? A few weeks after he was divorced from her husband, Ben and his new wife, who is the most famous celebrity in Hollywood, to find out how to make it easier for him to keep up with his wedding proposals and not keeping busy with work, writes the Daily Mail on Monday. The truth is that the star is now taking another step towards the end of this year. It is one that makes him very focused on his life. What happens for the rest of your life?</p>

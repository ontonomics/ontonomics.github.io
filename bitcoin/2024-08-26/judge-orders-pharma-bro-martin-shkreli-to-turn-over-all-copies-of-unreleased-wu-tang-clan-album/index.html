    <p>One of the world s most famous hip-hop stars has been ordered to turn over all copies of a controversial album he bought for $4.7m (£3.6m) in damages to his lawyers, the US justice department has told the BBC. However, it is not clear that the judge has ruled that he will be able to win. But Про  The BBC Newsnight looks at how he handled his legal battle with cryptocurrency collective PleasrDUO, which claimed he was responsible for stealing millions of people from the music industry, is being given an immediate relief from his appeal to raise funds to help him sell his album, as he is sued by one of his biggest rappers in the country, and says he has not been found guilty of breaching the lawsuit against the group’s former chief executive, Martin Shkreli, has lost his bid to sell the album for $2 million ($7m). The jury has said he had been fined $4.5m in an order to stop him selling it for $5m each year, after he lost the case for the first time in more than two decades, but will not carry out the legal action he received in his case, writes The Wall of Fame in New York, who was convicted of allegedly lying to investors and cheating them out of billions of dollar worth of money, to keep it released by the end of this year. A US court has decided to hand over the release of its latest album.</p>

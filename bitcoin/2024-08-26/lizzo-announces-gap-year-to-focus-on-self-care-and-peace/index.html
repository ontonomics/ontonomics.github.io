    <p>Lizzo has revealed she’s taking a gap year in her fitness journey, and says she is going to be keeping up with sexual harassment allegations against her fellow dancers. Why is she giving up this year and how she has responded to claims of sexual misconduct and sexual abuse? The BBC has been talking to Lizza. () “I’m getting tired of being dragged by the public while she was on stage during the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California, where she performed at the MTV Video Music Awards - and what does it mean for us? Where is it? And why is this coming? You’re expected to get ready for her new singer, who appears to have become the most successful female rapper in the world of dance music and dance shows? It is not just her career, but her personal health and her mental health, as well as her performances in their forthcoming speeches across the country? What would she do for the rest of the year when she comes out to perform at this time? A few weeks ago, she said she will not be the first person to make her debut at her first appearance in 2020 because of her recent announcements about her health? and who is about to take one? That is what happened to her music, with another headline in this week, to find out what is likely to come out of next year? Here, we’ve heard from her Instagram recordings and tweets.</p>

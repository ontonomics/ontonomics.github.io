  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin News Digest! We&rsquo;re here to give you the latest news in the exciting world of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital assets. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just curious about Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, we&rsquo;ve got something for you.
Bitget, a big cryptocurrency exchange, has added a popular memecoin called DOGS to its PoolX platform. New users can stake USDT and share in a pool of 500 million DOGS until September 2, 2024. This shows Bitget&rsquo;s support for new projects in the TON ecosystem. With over 900 coins and 1000&#43; pairs, Bitget offers early investment chances, proving it&rsquo;s a top crypto exchange.
In a big move, Nasdaq has asked the SEC to let them trade options on a Bitcoin index. These options, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Real-Time Index, will give big investors new ways to manage risks and invest in Bitcoin. If approved, this could make Bitcoin a more common investment, giving investors more choices.
China has brought back Zhang, the head of a huge cryptocurrency pyramid scheme, from Thailand. Zhang&rsquo;s scheme, &ldquo;MBI Group,&rdquo; cheated over 10 million people out of more than $14 billion. Even though China has banned cryptocurrency trading, illegal activities still happen, leading to global crackdowns on crypto crimes.
Russia is starting trials for cryptocurrency exchanges and token transactions to help with cross-border payments despite international sanctions. Starting September 1, these trials aim to give Russian businesses new payment methods. If they work, Russia might set up its own cryptocurrency exchanges next year, showing its effort to fight sanctions with digital currencies.
A judge in British Columbia has decided that a $1.2 million Bitcoin transfer was a loan, not an investment. The person who got the loan and didn&rsquo;t pay it back must return the money plus interest and court costs. This case shows the legal challenges of cryptocurrency transactions.
Consumer sentiment has gotten a bit better, but things like job market weakness and fewer purchasing plans suggest economic problems. Bitcoin&rsquo;s value has dropped, while gold prices have hit new highs. The market is still unstable, with a lot of focus on upcoming earnings reports.
H2O DAO saw a 2.1% drop in trading value, with a market cap of $362.87 million. Likewise, Galxe (GAL) had a 7.5% drop, trading at $2.27 per token. These tokens show the changing nature of the cryptocurrency market, affected by things like investor feelings and market dynamics.
In a key legal case, the Southern District of New York sided with Ripple Labs, saying XRP sales did not harm investors. Ripple faces a $125 million penalty and must avoid future violations, but the court did not approve the SEC&rsquo;s $876 million fine. This ruling might be appealed, affecting the rules around cryptocurrencies.
Pepe Unchained, a new crypto project, raised $10 million in its presale, mixing nostalgic charm with advanced blockchain tech. Meanwhile, Base Dawgz, inspired by Shiba Inu, is launching on Coinbase&rsquo;s Base Chain, offering cool features like multichain capabilities and high staking rewards.
Binance CEO Richard Teng has asked for the release of employee Tigran Gambaryan in Nigeria, denying claims of money laundering and terrorism financing. Teng stresses working with governments and criticizes the treatment of Gambaryan, showing the tough regulatory environment for crypto companies.
In a touching story, Girl Scout Troop 2383 raised $5,000 by selling cookies and donated a book vending machine to Newport Elementary. This project promotes reading and kindness, rewarding students for good deeds. The troop&rsquo;s hard work teaches important lessons in determination and selflessness.
A woman traveling with Telegram CEO Pavel Durov went missing after his arrest in France. Juli Vavilova, a video game streamer and &ldquo;crypto coach,&rdquo; was last seen sharing travel photos. Durov faces serious charges related to his platform, including child pornography and money laundering, raising concerns for the crypto community.

    <p>One of the world s richest men, Pavel Durov, has been arrested in Paris on suspicion of spreading extremist content on his Telegram messaging app, the French justice ministry has said, after he was released from the country on Wednesday. However, he has become a controversial figure in Russia and around the planet. The BBC understands. But Про (The BBC reports from Russia, Russia, France and the US - including the BBC, it is possible that he is among those who are behind the investigation into his arrest and why he appears to be the most prolific man on the internet, and is now being investigated by French prosecutors in the wake of his sensational arrest in Moscow, as they arrest him for allegedly trying to stop the  spread of extremism  on social network Telegram, but could he be banned from leaving France, writes Richard A Brooks, who says he will be known as Dmitry Medvedev, one of who is in charge of an espionage against the Russian authorities in France which is under increased scrutiny over his alleged use of social media giant Telegram and how he can make his way to avoid threats of terrorist attacks on him and other people in his country and for the past two weeks, in what is the story of him when he comes from Saint Petersburg, Paris, to the UK and in Europe where he founded the Telegram platform, is not going to get involved in an arrest on Friday. But what does it mean for him?</p>

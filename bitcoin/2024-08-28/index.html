  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin Daily Digest! Here, we bring you the latest news about cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital money. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just curious about virtual currency, we&rsquo;ve got something for you.
Stacks, a well-known Bitcoin layer-2 solution, has launched the Satoshi upgrade. This is a big step in digital currency. The upgrade makes Stacks&#39; block production separate from Bitcoin&rsquo;s, making the network faster and more efficient. Network operators have two weeks to apply the Nakamoto upgrade before a hard fork completes the process. This shows how blockchain technology keeps improving, offering a stronger and more flexible platform for electronic currency transactions.
Iris Energy Limited has reported a record Bitcoin mining revenue of $184.1 million for the fiscal year. This shows how profitable crypto mining is becoming. The company reached this number by increasing its hash rate and benefiting from good Bitcoin prices. Its self-mining capacity grew from 5.6 EH/s to 10 EH/s, leading to the mining of 4,191 Bitcoin. However, this growth also increased net electricity costs to $76 million. Iris Energy plans to reach a self-mining capacity of 20 EH/s next month and 30 EH/s by the end of the year. After this news, the company&rsquo;s stock price went up by 5.12%, showing investor confidence. CEO Daniel Roberts is happy with the company&rsquo;s growth in revenue, earnings, and cash flow, highlighting digital money as a profitable venture.
Pavel Durov, a Russian tech entrepreneur, is making a big impact in cybercurrency and social media. He founded VKontakte and later Telegram, building a digital empire with over 900 million users. Despite facing controversies and clashes with authorities, he supports internet privacy and free speech. Durov, a self-proclaimed libertarian, left Russia for Dubai, where he continues to innovate. His ventures into cryptocurrencies show his commitment to freedom of expression and decentralization. Durov&rsquo;s dedication to these principles is clear in his personal and professional life, making him an important figure in the digital currency world.
As we explore the changing world of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital cash, it&rsquo;s clear that innovators like those at Stacks, Iris Energy, and Pavel Durov are pushing the industry forward. Their work not only improves the functionality and profitability of virtual currency but also supports the values of freedom and privacy. Understanding and engaging with these advancements in digital money can lead to a more secure and prosperous future.
Public perception is crucial for the success of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For example, when Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as payment, the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s value increased, showing more public confidence. On the other hand, when China restricted Bitcoin mining, the market went down. These examples show how major announcements and regulatory changes can impact the cryptocurrency landscape.
Stay tuned for more updates and insights into the exciting world of electronic currency. Together, we can embrace the future of digital finance and build a better tomorrow.

  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin Digest! We bring you the latest news about cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital money. Whether you&rsquo;re an expert investor or just curious, we&rsquo;ve got something for you.
Unlimit and Alchemy Pay are working together to connect regular and crypto payments. They want to grow in places like the European Union, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Alchemy Pay helps people buy crypto with regular money in 173 countries. This partnership aims to make payments easier, keep customers happy, and reduce problems. Irene Skrynova from Unlimit and Robert McCracken from Alchemy Pay are excited about this plan.
The cryptocurrency market has had some ups and downs recently. Here are some updates:


Metadium (META): Its value dropped by 1.8%, and it now has a market cap of $42.01 million. Metadium helps create secure online identities with its &ldquo;Meta ID&rdquo; service. To buy Metadium, people often first buy Ethereum or Bitcoin.


Render Token (RNDR): Its value went down slightly, with a market cap of $2.05 billion. It uses a decentralized system for GPU-based rendering. RNDR&rsquo;s value fell by 7.8% over the past week. You can buy RNDR on major crypto exchanges.


Euler Token: Its value decreased by 2.5%, with a market cap of $88.99 million. Euler is a DeFi protocol on Ethereum, which allows lending and borrowing of digital assets. People usually buy Ethereum or Bitcoin first to get Euler.


GeniuX (IUX): Its value dropped by 8.8%, with a market cap of $22,540.28. Founded in 2018, GeniuX helps turn real-world assets into digital tokens. Investors often buy Ethereum or Bitcoin first to get GeniuX.


Goldfinch (GFI): Its value fell by 3.3%, with a market cap of $187.98 million. Goldfinch offers unique crypto loans without needing collateral. The GFI token is used for governance and community grants. To buy GFI, people usually get Ethereum or Bitcoin first.


These changes show how fast the cryptocurrency market can move. From better payment systems to new ways of investing, digital money keeps evolving.
It&rsquo;s important to stay updated because digital money is becoming a big part of our financial system. Public opinion matters a lot. For example, when Tesla said it would accept Bitcoin for car purchases, Bitcoin&rsquo;s value went up. But when China cracked down on crypto mining and trading, Bitcoin&rsquo;s value dropped. This shows how news and regulations can affect the market.
Knowing these trends can help you make smart choices and understand how cryptocurrency affects the world economy. Stay tuned for more updates in our next Bitcoin Digest, and keep exploring the exciting world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

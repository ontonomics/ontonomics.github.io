    <p>Tributes have been paid to Slipknot DJ Sid Wilson, who is expected to play as part of a live show in Los Angeles, says he has been keeping up his perfect attendance record for the forthcoming  Grammy Awards in 2024, but doesn’t want to miss it again, he told the US broadcaster, TMZ, on Friday.. ().  The singer has revealed he is still in pain from the fire that killed himself and Kelly Osbourne, and his wife, Kelly O Connor, has spoken of his dedication to maintaining the record after being hit by an apparent fire in California, in the wake of the tragedy, saying he will be alright, after he was knocked down when he attended the show, as he prepared to perform at the top of this year’s annual awards at Crypto.com Arena, at which they are due to be announced on the day he had another show since January, with serious burns to his face and arms in his car while taking part in what happened during their live appearance in 2020, to make his debut at this weekend, the BBC has learned about why he didn t miss one because of fears that he may have missed one show before, despite having to take safety measures and becoming the first DJ to attend the event, for making his way out of an event - and has said he wants the music industry to keep up the number of fans coming to the scene, writes The Boss.</p>

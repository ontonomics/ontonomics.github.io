  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest! We&rsquo;re here to give you the latest news in the world of cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an expert or just starting out, we&rsquo;ve got the news and tips you need.
On Monday evening, Bitcoin went up by more than 5%. This rise happened as Wall Street recovered from its worst week this year. This brings new hope to the cryptocurrency market, which has had mixed results lately.
Stablecoins like Dai (DAI) and USD Coin (USDC) are holding steady against the U.S. dollar. DAI has a market cap of $5.37 billion, and USDC has a market cap of $35.15 billion. These coins are important in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) world because they stay stable even when the market is shaky.
Here are some updates on other coins:

Astrafer (ASTRAFER) stayed stable but went down by 8.3% over the past week.
DIMO (DIMO) went up by 1.6% against the dollar and rose by 7.5% over the week.
Games for a Living (GFAL) had a small increase but dropped by 2.1% over the week.
Centurion (CNT) went up by 4.7% in a day but dropped by 3.4% over the week.
Cosmos (ATOM) went up by 8.6% in a day but traded 7.9% lower over the week.
Flare (FLR) went up by 3.4% in a day but dropped by 5.7% over the week.
Origin Protocol (OGN) went up by 2.4% in a day but dropped by 9.6% over the week.
Wrapped Everscale (WEVER) went up by 2.6% in a day but dropped by 2% over the week.
Terra (LUNA) went up by 4.6% in a day and 2.2% over the week.
Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA) went up by 5.4% in a day and stayed stable over the week.
Bitget Token (BGB) had a small increase but dropped by 3.5% over the week.
Jito (JTO) went up by 1.5% in a day but dropped by 6.1% over the week.
Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) went up by 4.7% in a day but dropped by 3% over the week.
Locus Chain (LOCUS) went down by 4.4% in a day and dropped by 10.6% over the week.

The FBI reported a big rise in cryptocurrency scams in 2023. Victims lost $5.6 billion, a 45% increase from 2022. Most of these scams involved Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, making up 71% of the total losses. Most complaints came from people over 60, but those aged 30-39 were also hit hard. The FBI advises you to be careful and check any online investment opportunities thoroughly.
New tokens and platforms are also making news:

Astrafer (ASTRAFER), started in 2022 on the Polygon platform, has a total of 888 million tokens.
DIMO (DIMO), started in December 2021, also works on the Polygon platform with a total of 1 billion tokens.
Games for a Living (GFAL), started in March 2023, works on the BNB Smart Chain.
Centurion (CNT) is a mineable coin traded on six active markets.
Cosmos (ATOM), started in 2016, uses its token for transaction fees, staking, and governance.
Flare (FLR), started in January 2023, has a total of 102.48 billion coins.
Origin Protocol (OGN), started in January 2020, is a decentralized platform for peer-to-peer marketplaces.
Wrapped Everscale (WEVER), started in May 2020, works on the Everscale platform.
Terra (LUNA), an open-source blockchain for decentralized apps, started its new mainnet in May 2022.
Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA), a DeFi platform for cross-chain work, started in September 2020.
Bitget Token (BGB), working on the Ethereum platform, has a total of 2 billion tokens.
Jito (JTO), started in December 2023 on the Solana platform, has a total of 1 billion tokens.
Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), an ERC-20 token, boosts Bitcoin&rsquo;s liquidity in DeFi.
Locus Chain (LOCUS), started in April 2018, uses Account Wise Transaction Chain (AWTC) for fast transactions.

The cryptocurrency market keeps changing, with new developments in decentralized finance, stablecoins, and new tokens. While the chance for high returns is exciting, it&rsquo;s important to watch out for scams. Do your research and invest carefully.
Public opinion affects how well cryptocurrencies do. For example, in 2017, Bitcoin&rsquo;s surge brought in many new investors due to media hype. But the crash that followed made many people skeptical. Another example is Dogecoin, which started as a joke but became popular because of endorsements from famous people like Elon Musk. This shows how public figures and media can influence market trends and investor behavior.
Understanding these factors helps investors make smart choices and avoid mistakes. Stay tuned for more updates in our next edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest. Let&rsquo;s work together to build a better financial future.

  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin Daily Digest! We bring you the latest news from the exciting world of cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just curious, we&rsquo;ve got the most interesting stories for you.
A Japanese investment firm named Metaplanet bought $2 million more in Bitcoin. Now, they own almost 400 BTC. This is similar to what another company, MicroStrategy, is doing. Metaplanet bought Bitcoin at an average price of $65,700 each. After the news, their stock went up by 5.87%. Bitcoin&rsquo;s price also went up by 3.4% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $57,159.
Experts have different opinions about Bitcoin&rsquo;s future. Jesse Olson thinks Bitcoin could fall to $40,000, even though it recently went up to $58,000. Mikybull Crypto is more positive, saying a bullish diamond formation could mean good things. Rekt Capital believes October could see a big price rally, as it has been a strong month for Bitcoin in the past.
Other cryptocurrencies are also seeing changes. Ethernity Chain (ERN) went up by 1.2%, trading at $2.04. VerusCoin (VRSC) rose by 4.4%, trading at $1.58. Solana (SOL) gained 4% over the past week, now at $135.31. Enigma (ENG) stayed the same, and Kelp DAO Restaked ETH (RSETH) saw a small drop. VVS Finance (VVS) and Banana Gun (BANANA) had mixed results.
A big investor moved 4 trillion Pepe Coin tokens worth $29.8 million, showing confidence in meme coins. SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, holds 8,285 Bitcoin worth $471.48 million, showing long-term trust in Bitcoin. Standard Chartered started a digital asset custody service in the UAE, a big step in their digital asset plans.
The UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said over 87% of crypto registrations were rejected to fight fraud and protect consumers. An FBI report showed Americans lost $5.6 billion to crypto fraud in 2023, a 45% increase from 2022. Both the FCA and FBI are working hard to make crypto safer for everyone.
PayPal and Venmo now use Ethereum Name Service (ENS) on their platforms. This lets users send and receive crypto using easy-to-read usernames. This move aims to make transactions simpler and more accurate.
AI-powered cryptocurrencies like Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX) are doing very well. This comes after Apple announced AI-powered tools for the iPhone 16, making Apple a strong player in the AI field.
T-mac DAO (TMG) went up by 2%, trading at about $12.20. Ampleforth Governance Token (FORTH) rose 2.1% to $2.96. These tokens show how important community and governance are in the crypto world.
The world of cryptocurrency is always changing. Big moves by investors, mixed market results, and new rules are all part of this. Staying informed is key to navigating this space. We hope today&rsquo;s digest gave you useful insights into Bitcoin and more.
Stay tuned for more updates. Remember, your journey in the digital asset world is just starting. Let&rsquo;s make wise investment choices to leave a better world for our children.
Thank you for joining us today. Until next time, happy investing!

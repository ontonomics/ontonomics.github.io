    <p> Former President Donald Trump plans to address cryptocurrency and his new venture, World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform controlled by his sons Donald Jr. and Eric. Trump s speech is scheduled for 50 days before the upcoming Election Day, marking a significant use of his remaining campaign time to promote a personal business. Throughout his 2024 campaign, Trump has intertwined his political and business interests, marketing various products including sneakers, photo books, and Trump-branded Bibles.  In a recent video, Trump expressed his support for cryptocurrencies, stating that the United States should embrace this future technology and move away from traditional big banks. The Winnipeg Free Press reports that cryptocurrencies are digital forms of money that can be traded online without relying on the global banking system. However, Trump s stance on cryptocurrencies has evolved over time. During his presidency, he opposed the sector, but has since shown support for it.  Trump has suggested that the government create a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and has vowed to block the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a digital form of central bank money available to the public. This shift in Trump s position on cryptocurrencies has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as he could use the federal government to support a business tied to his family.  On game days for the Winnipeg Jets, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe provide news, notes, and quotes from the morning skate, along with injury updates and lineup decisions. The Warm-Up newsletter arrives a few hours before the puck drops.  In summary, former President Donald Trump plans to discuss cryptocurrency and his new crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, during his upcoming speech. His evolving stance on cryptocurrencies has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as he has previously opposed the sector but now supports it. The Winnipeg Jets  hockey writers provide updates on game days, while the Warm-Up newsletter offers insights into the sport.</p>

  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest! Here, we bring you the latest news and insights about cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just curious, we&rsquo;ve got something for you. Let&rsquo;s look at the main stories in the crypto world today.
In 2023, scams and frauds in cryptocurrency have caused huge losses, with about $5.6 billion stolen, says the FBI. Since cryptocurrency is decentralized and transactions happen quickly, it attracts criminals. This makes it hard for law enforcement to catch them. People aged 30-39 and 40-49 are most affected, but those over 60 lost the most money, over $1.24 billion. The FBI advises everyone to be careful and report any suspected fraud.
Some cryptocurrencies have dropped in value this past week. Tezos (XTZ) fell 1.1% against the dollar in the last 24 hours and 2.4% over the week, now trading at $0.63. ERC20 stayed the same against the dollar but dropped 0.8% over the week, now at $0.0037. Axie Infinity (AXS) went down 3.2% in the past day, now at $4.48. Horizen (ZEN) also fell 3.2%, now at $7.65.
BlackCardCoin (BCCOIN) had a big drop of 4.8% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $7.28 million. Rocket Pool (RPL) fell 6.8%, now trading at $9.30. Verge (XVG) dropped 4.4%, now valued at $0.0035. LooksRare (LOOKS) fell 7.4%, now at $0.0394. Swipe (SXP) dropped 5.1%, now priced at $0.20. Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA) saw a 7% decrease, now trading at $0.0530.
Despite these declines, XRP (XRP) has been strong, increasing by 1.1% in the past 24 hours and 8% over the last week. With a market cap of $32.89 billion, XRP is trading at $0.58. Created in 2013, XRP aims to offer fast and eco-friendly transactions and is used in RippleNet for cross-border payments.
Young investors, aged 27 and under, have about 30% of their investments in cryptocurrency. In contrast, Baby Boomers have only 1-2% in crypto. Young people like the unique and high-return potential of digital assets, even though they can be risky. Older generations prefer safer investments like gold, which is seen as protection against inflation and economic problems.
Overnight, financial markets were excited about a possible -50 bps rate cut from the US Fed. The NY Empire State Manufacturing Index went up unexpectedly, and Canada&rsquo;s July manufacturing levels were better than expected. However, a typhoon in Shanghai affected holiday spending. The ASX200 reached a record high, while the USD and global interest rates fell. Gold and oil prices went up, but Bitcoin fell by 3%.
Virtual currency (VC) in video games is used to buy in-game items like skins. Popular games like &ldquo;NBA 2k&rdquo; and &ldquo;Destiny 2&rdquo; have VC. Some of these currencies can be earned through gameplay, but others need real money. Paid VCs are often criticized for being unfair, using gambling-like tricks, and making players buy set amounts, which can lead to overspending. This is especially bad for young players. Unlike cryptocurrency, VC guarantees in-game purchases.
As we continue to explore the world of cryptocurrency, it&rsquo;s important to stay informed and careful. Whether you&rsquo;re investing or just curious, knowing the risks and opportunities is key. Stay tuned for more updates in our next edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest.

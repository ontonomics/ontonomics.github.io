    <p> Virtual Currency (VC) is a term commonly used to describe in-game currency that allows players to purchase virtual items such as cosmetic skins and materials. This concept is prevalent in various video games, including the  NBA 2k  series, where VC is used within the game s menus and purchase points. However, the use of virtual money in gaming predates this popularization.  In some games, like  Destiny 2,  there are multiple forms of virtual currency. Glimmer is the primary in-game currency that can be earned by playing, while Silver is a paid virtual currency that requires real-life money to purchase coveted cosmetic items from the game s virtual storefront, Eververse.  The use of paid virtual currencies has faced criticism due to their resemblance to gambling mechanisms and their popularity among children. Additionally, games often force players to buy virtual currency in set amounts, leading to overspending. The difficulty in calculating exchange values between in-game currency and real money has also been seen as a manipulation tactic, as evidenced by a teenager who spent $10,000 on microtransactions.  The term  virtual currency  can sometimes be confused with cryptocurrency, which is also referred to as virtual currency. However, unlike cryptocurrency, purchasing video game currency guarantees access to new cosmetic items, as seen in  Fortnite.   In summary, virtual currency (VC) is a prevalent feature in many video games, allowing players to purchase in-game items. While it can be earned through gameplay, some forms of VC require real-life money, leading to criticism and concerns about manipulation and overspending, especially among younger players. The term VC can also be confused with cryptocurrency, which operates differently in the gaming context.</p>

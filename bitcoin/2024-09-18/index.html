Hackers have demanded $6 million in bitcoin from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport operator after a cyberattack last month. The hackers, known as the Rhysida group, have posted stolen data on the dark web. Despite the attack, flights continued as planned. The Port of Seattle has refused to pay the ransom, and the FBI is investigating. This shows the growing cybersecurity threats to important places and the use of bitcoin in ransom demands. People should know about these threats to understand the risks and take precautions.
Former President Donald Trump was seen handing out hamburgers at PubKey, a Bitcoin-themed bar in New York City. More importantly, he made his first public cryptocurrency transaction. This is a historic moment as he is the first president to use bitcoin. Trump, who supports cryptocurrencies, recently announced his new business, World Liberty Financial. This could mean that digital money is becoming more accepted in regular financial activities. When famous people like Trump use bitcoin, it can make more people want to use it too.
The B.C. Securities Commission has fined LiquiTrade Ltd., a crypto trading platform based in the Cayman Islands, $500,000. The platform, known as Latoken, was marketed to B.C. residents without proper registration. Even though they blocked B.C. IP addresses, users could still access it using VPNs. This decision shows the problems and risks with unregistered crypto exchanges. The commission’s actions stress the need for rules to protect investors from the risky nature of crypto assets. Knowing about these actions can help users make smart decisions and avoid problems.
In market news, Fetch.ai (FET) saw a 3.4% increase against the dollar, trading at about $1.40. This AI technology platform is getting more attention from investors. Guild of Guardians (GOG), a mobile RPG token, also went up by 0.9%, showing growing interest in blockchain-based gaming. On the other hand, Neutrino USD (USDN) fell by 2.8% in one day, highlighting the ups and downs in the crypto market. Bondly (BONDLY) also saw a slight decrease, trading at $0.0021. These changes remind investors of the risks and the importance of staying informed. Understanding market movements can help users navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency investments.
ReddCoin (RDD) saw a big 17.9% increase against the US dollar, trading at about $0.0001. ReddCoin is known for helping with social network donations. Its rise shows a growing interest in using cryptocurrencies with social media platforms. This trend could make digital money more common in everyday transactions. Knowing about these trends can help users understand the changing world of digital currencies and their uses.
JustMarkets, a well-known multi-asset broker, has debunked common myths about online trading.

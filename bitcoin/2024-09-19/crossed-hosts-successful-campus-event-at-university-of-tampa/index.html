    <p> The University of Tampa recently hosted a successful two-day event to introduce Crossed, an innovative social networking app designed to foster authentic, in-person connections among students. The event, held at Vaughn Courtyard and Sykes College of Business, attracted thousands of students who engaged with the Crossed team, downloaded the app, and explored its potential to enhance their college experience.  Crossed s CEO, Manny Manzel, and co-founder Conor Crighton, along with volunteers from various sororities, aimed to show that Crossed is more than a corporate-backed app. It is a tool created by former college students to help make meaningful, real-life connections. The event featured a vibrant setup with a large tent, exciting prizes, and raffles to engage students.  The turnout was impressive, with hundreds of students stopping by the Crossed table every hour. The team shared how Crossed can help students meet new people, engage in activities around campus, and make their networking experiences more meaningful. Manny noted the enthusiasm and positive reception from students, who appreciated an app that prioritizes authentic connections.  By the end of the event, thousands of students had downloaded Crossed, marking a significant step forward in the app s expansion on college campuses. Crossed aims to continue its mission of bringing genuine connections to the college community, with events like these playing a crucial role in driving awareness and adoption.

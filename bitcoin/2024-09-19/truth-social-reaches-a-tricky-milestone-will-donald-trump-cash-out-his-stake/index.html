    <p> The future of Trump Media, a social media company majority-owned by former President Donald Trump, is facing increasing uncertainty. The company s shares have dropped nearly 80% since its public offering in March, hitting an all-time low of $14.77 on Thursday. Trump Media s share price fell more than 4% on Thursday morning, amidst the expiration of a lockup on insider sales. This means Trump could potentially sell his 57% stake, currently valued at around $2 billion.  Despite Trump s statement that he has no intention of selling his stake in Truth Social, investors are wary of the potential impact on the company s share price. The stock s performance has become a barometer for investor sentiment towards Trump s election campaign. Trump Media s shares rallied in July after Trump survived an assassination attempt, but plummeted following a debate with Vice President Harris.  Truth Social s future is closely tied to the upcoming election, with its share performance likely to improve if Trump wins and worsen if he loses. The company has reported a loss of more than $16 million in its most recent quarterly earnings, and there are signs of declining demand for its core product.  Trump Media s status as a meme stock, bought and sold more for its symbolic value than any underlying business performance, further complicates its future. The company was founded in 2022 as a conservative social media network after Trump was banned from Twitter. However, with Elon Musk s takeover of Twitter, Trump has been welcomed back, and he even debuted a new crypto platform on the platform earlier this week.  Investors in Trump Media are largely the former president s most loyal supporters, and the company s share performance has become a Wall Street weathervane for how investors perceive Trump s election campaign. The shares are expected to surge if Trump wins the election and plummet if he loses.  Trump Media did not respond to a request for comment from NPR, leaving its future uncertain amidst the ongoing election and potential insider sales.</p>

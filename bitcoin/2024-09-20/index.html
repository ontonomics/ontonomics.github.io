  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin and Beyond: Today&rsquo;s Key Developments in the World of Cryptocurrency
Welcome to today&rsquo;s news! We bring you the latest updates on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Whether you are an investor or just curious, we&rsquo;ve got something for you.
Shiba Inu&rsquo;s Big Tease
Shytoshi Kusama, the leader of Shiba Inu, has excited the SHIB community. After attending the TOKEN2049 blockchain conference in Singapore, Kusama hinted at big news. Her recent visits to Mumbai, India, and Kyoto, Japan, have increased the excitement. SHIB holders are eagerly waiting for major updates.
Institutional Adoption on the Rise
BNY Mellon has received special permission from the SEC to grow its crypto business. This shows more big companies are interested in digital assets. The permission means BNY Mellon must protect its clients and work with state regulators. This could lead to more traditional banks entering the crypto market, showing that digital assets are becoming more accepted.
Scams on the Rise
A BBB investigation has found a big increase in investment scams, especially with cryptocurrency. Losses have gone up almost six times, with scammers often building trust through romantic or mentor relationships. The median loss has risen from $1,000 in 2021 to $6,000 in 2024. Washington alone reported $1.9 million in losses this year, mostly in crypto. Watch out for unknown &ldquo;gurus,&rdquo; obscure cryptocurrencies, and offers that seem too good to be true. Victims should block and report scammers and use trusted investment sources.
Extortion Scams in B.C.
A known extortion scam is rising in B.C., with Surrey RCMP receiving 29 reports in just three days. Scammers claim to have embarrassing photos or browsing history of victims and demand Bitcoin payments, threatening exposure to family and friends. Similar scams have been reported in North Vancouver and Ridge Meadows. The RCMP advises the public to stay alert, not comply with threats, and report such incidents. Victims should stop communication, deactivate accounts, and keep evidence for the police.
Bitcoin Custody Services by Major Banks?
Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has shared rumors that big US banks may soon offer Bitcoin custody services. This could change the relationship between traditional finance and digital assets. This news follows BNY Mellon&rsquo;s recent special permission from the SEC, which requires banks to include digital assets on their balance sheets. Despite efforts to change this rule, its future is still unclear.
Bitcoin Price Predictions
Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered predicts that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. This is due to economic conditions, ETF growth, and possible changes in US rules. Key factors include a slight increase in inflation, positive Bitcoin ETF flows, and the possible repeal of the SAB-121 rule. Regardless of the 2024 US presidential election outcome, Bitcoin is expected to peak at $125,000 by the end of 2024 and hit $200,000 by the end of 2025.
XRP&rsquo;s Potential Surge
Crypto experts think XRP could hit $2 by 2025. This is driven by Bitcoin&rsquo;s potential rise to $150,000 and clearer rules. The SEC is unlikely to appeal the Ripple verdict, setting a positive precedent. Bitcoin&rsquo;s price is expected to surge, with analysts forecasting $100,000 to $150,000. Recent Bitcoin price movements suggest a bullish trend, though consolidation above $67K is needed for further gains. XRP is anticipated to rise 25% to $0.75 soon, with a potential surge to $1 in Q4 2025.
Nasdaq&rsquo;s Bitcoin ETF Options
The US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved Nasdaq&rsquo;s application to list options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. This is a big step before derivatives trading can start. This approval is expected to attract more investors and liquidity. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, trading under the ticker IBIT, is the largest Bitcoin ETF with $22.7 billion in assets.
Blockchain in Government
Vice President Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo announced plans to introduce blockchain technology in several government agencies in Guyana. This includes the Lands and Survey Commission and the Geology and Mines Commission. Blockchain will enhance transparency and prevent tampering with records, such as leases and prospecting licenses. The government is also considering expanding this technology to other agencies.
Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to explore the world of cryptocurrency. Your curiosity and engagement are key to understanding and shaping the future of digital assets.

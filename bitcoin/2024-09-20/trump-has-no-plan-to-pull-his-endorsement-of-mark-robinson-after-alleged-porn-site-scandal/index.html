    <p> Donald Trump faces internal and external pressure to withdraw his endorsement of North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson amidst scandal-plagued allegations of offensive comments posted on a pornography website. Despite these calls, Trump s campaign has so far not planned a formal withdrawal.  Robinson, the state s lieutenant governor, posted derogatory remarks on a pornography website between 2008 and 2012, including referring to himself as a  black NAZI,  enjoying  tranny  porn, and spying on women in public gym showers when he was 14. These comments have sparked controversy and led to calls for Trump to reconsider his endorsement.  Trump s campaign, however, has remained steadfast in its support for Robinson. Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed reports of a potential withdrawal as  false,  and Trump himself has been hesitant to backtrack on endorsements publicly, fearing it would make him appear weak.  Some advisers within Trump s campaign have privately urged him to withdraw his endorsement, but these requests have not swayed the former president. Republican members of the North Carolina congressional delegation, including Senators Ted Budd and Thom Tillis, and RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, have also privately urged Trump to reconsider his support for Robinson.  Despite the controversy, Robinson will not be attending a Trump rally in Wilmington, North Carolina. The political fallout from Robinson s past comments could be particularly tough for Trump, as North Carolina is a key swing state in the upcoming presidential election.  In the meantime, Trump has been in close contact with Whatley, who also hails from North Carolina, as he navigates the situation. However, if Trump does decide to pull his support, it would be a departure from his previous endorsement decisions.  The Republican Governors Association has not commented on the situation, and the political fallout from Robinson s past comments could intensify as the election approaches.</p>

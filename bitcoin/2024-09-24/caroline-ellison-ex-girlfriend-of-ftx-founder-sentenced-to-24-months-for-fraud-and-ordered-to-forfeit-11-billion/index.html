    <p> Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research and former boyfriend of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, pleaded guilty to seven fraud and money-laundering charges related to one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history. In a tearful testimony, Ellison admitted to being exploited and manipulated by Bankman-Fried, and expressed regret for her actions. She agreed to forfeit $11 billion and will serve a 25-year prison sentence.  Ellison s cooperation with federal prosecutors has been praised by Judge Lewis Kaplan, who described her as a strong but not invincible individual. Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon also advocated for a lenient sentence, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between the mastermind and the accomplice.  During the trial, Ellison provided detailed testimony about her relationship with Bankman-Fried, including how he mistreated her and knowingly defrauded investors. She also revealed that Bankman-Fried and she bribed Chinese officials with $100 million to regain access to frozen cryptocurrency.  While awaiting sentencing, Ellison has remained out of the public eye. She has volunteered at a soup kitchen, fostered rescue dogs, and helped low-income families with their taxes. She has also worked with a nonprofit group that sends books to inmates and has written personal notes of encouragement to them. Despite her low profile, Ellison has been described as quiet but helpful and punctual in her volunteer work.  Ellison s testimony and cooperation with the government have been crucial in the case against Bankman-Fried, who was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Ellison s actions have contributed to the downfall of Bankman-Fried, who went from being a billionaire and major political donor to facing one of the biggest financial fraud cases in U.S. history.</p>

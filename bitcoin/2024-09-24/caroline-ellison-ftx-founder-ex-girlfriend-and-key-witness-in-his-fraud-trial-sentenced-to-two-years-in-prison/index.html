    <p> Caroline Ellison, a former crypto executive and key witness in the conviction of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to two years in prison for her involvement in one of the largest financial frauds in history. Ellison, 29, pleaded guilty to multiple charges in a federal fraud and conspiracy case related to the crypto trading platform. She cooperated with prosecutors and testified during the trial, revealing her fraudulent actions with Bankman-Fried, her former boyfriend.  Judge Lewis Kaplan praised Ellison s cooperation, noting a significant distinction between her and Bankman-Fried, who denied the entire situation. Despite her substantial cooperation, Kaplan emphasized that it did not exempt her from prison time. Ellison expressed remorse and apologized to the victims, acknowledging the harm she caused.  Ellison s attorney, Anjan Sahni, argued for leniency, highlighting her moral recovery and the positive impact she could still make. Assistant United States Attorney Danielle Sassoon also supported leniency, citing Ellison s truthfulness and acceptance of her culpability.  Before sentencing, Ellison s attorneys urged Kaplan to consider her early disclosure of the crimes, unmitigated acceptance of responsibility, and extensive cooperation with the government. Prosecutors agreed that Ellison s cooperation was crucial to the successful prosecution of Bankman-Fried.  Two other former FTX executives, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, are set to be sentenced in October and November, respectively. Bankman-Fried has filed an appeal to overturn his conviction. The government can use the $11 billion forfeited by Bankman-Fried to compensate victims.</p>

    <p> Caroline Ellison, a former crypto executive and co-chief executive of Alameda Research, was sentenced to two years in prison for her involvement in one of the largest financial frauds in history. Ellison, 29, pleaded guilty to multiple charges in the federal fraud and conspiracy case related to the crypto trading platform FTX. She cooperated with prosecutors and was a key witness during the trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  Ellison testified that she committed fraud with her former boyfriend, Bankman-Fried, and at his direction. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all counts for defrauding FTX customers out of $8 billion. Prior to her sentencing, Ellison s attorneys urged Judge Lewis Kaplan to be lenient, highlighting her credible cooperation and acknowledgment of her wrongdoing.  Federal prosecutors agreed that Ellison s cooperation was crucial to the successful prosecution of Bankman-Fried. Ellison disclosed the crimes to her employees before FTX s bankruptcy declaration on November 9, 2022, and approached her cooperation with remorse and seriousness.  Ellison initially faced a potential 110-year prison sentence, but defense attorneys suggested a sentence in line with a recommendation from probation officials, which included time served plus three years supervised release. They argued that Ellison poses no risk of recidivism and presents no threat to public safety, and that leniency should be granted in recognition of her early disclosure, acceptance of responsibility, and extensive cooperation with the government.  Two other former FTX executives, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, who also pleaded guilty in the case, are set to be sentenced in October and November, respectively. Bankman-Fried has filed an appeal to overturn his conviction.</p>

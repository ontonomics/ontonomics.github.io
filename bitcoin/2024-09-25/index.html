  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin News Digest! Here, we talk about the latest news in cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital assets. Our goal is to help you see how these new ideas can make a better future for you and your family. Let&rsquo;s dive into today&rsquo;s top stories.
Vice President Kamala Harris shared her &ldquo;Opportunity Economy&rdquo; plan. She wants to help the middle class and support new ideas. Blockchain technology can help by making finances fairer, helping small businesses, and supporting clean energy. With decentralized ledgers, we can improve job training and affordable housing, boosting economic growth.
Several cryptocurrencies performed well last week:

ZEDXION (USDZ) stayed stable with a market value of $2.32 billion.
Non-Playable Coin (NPC) jumped by 79.9%, now at $0.0245.
Dogecoin (DOGE) rose by 7.8%, now at $0.11.
Axie Infinity (AXS) went up by 12.8%, now at $5.23.
Ethereum (ETH) increased by 13%, thanks to big transactions.

PayPal announced that U.S. business accounts can now buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency. This new feature helps merchants use digital currencies more easily, making crypto more common in daily transactions.
BlackRock has bought a lot more Bitcoin, making people hopeful that Bitcoin might reach $70,000. Interest in Bitcoin ETFs is growing, and some think Bitcoin could reach $172,800 by the end of 2024.
Ethereum&rsquo;s burn rate has gone up by 168%, lowering its supply and possibly raising its price. More activity in decentralized banking and NFTs has caused this. Ethereum is now priced at $2,617, and experts see more gains coming.
Solana is attracting users from Ethereum because of its fast transactions and low fees. It has 1,300% more daily users and 3000% more transactions. Some believe Solana could challenge Ethereum&rsquo;s top spot. Experts predict Solana&rsquo;s price could reach $330.
South Korea is starting the Digital Asset User Protection Foundation to help people get their money back from failed crypto exchanges. This will help manage and recover users&#39; funds, giving more security and peace of mind.
Cryptocurrency prices can change a lot, and there are still scams. Rules are getting stricter, and blockchain technology is growing fast. It&rsquo;s important to stay informed and careful in this changing world.
Keshav, a freelance writer, talks about finding his love for writing during the COVID-19 pandemic. He shares his experiences in the crypto world, from staking to decentralized finance.
Bitcoin is now trading above $63,500, a 7% increase from last week. While the trend is up, traders should watch prices closely, as they can still change quickly.
As we keep exploring cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital assets, it&rsquo;s clear these technologies have a lot of potential. By staying informed and open to new ideas, we can help make a better future for ourselves and our families.

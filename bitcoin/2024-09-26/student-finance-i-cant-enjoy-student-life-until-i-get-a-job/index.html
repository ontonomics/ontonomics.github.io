    <p> Jordan Andrews, an 18-year-old from Carmarthenshire, is seeking part-time work to supplement his income while studying at the University of Sussex. He quickly realized that his maintenance loan would only cover the bare minimum of his expenses, which include rent, textbooks, and daily expenses like coffee.  Students in Wales have access to more support for living costs compared to other parts of the UK, but they still face financial challenges. The Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) estimates that the cost of living for a minimum acceptable standard of living is £18,632 a year outside London, while support for Welsh students covers only 65% of this amount.  To help students like Jordan, universities offer various resources, such as money advice services, hardship funds, and discounts. For example, Swansea University has seen a 2.5% increase in applications for its hardship fund, and Cardiff University has introduced a one-off accommodation payment of £750.  In addition to seeking part-time work and utilizing university resources, students can also save money by asking for discounts in smaller shops and restaurants, exploring bursaries, grants, and scholarships, and choosing the right bank account with a good-sized 0% overdraft facility.  Despite the financial challenges, many students, like Famke Veenstra-Ashmore, believe that the experience gained from attending university is worth the investment. However, the proportion of Welsh 18-year-olds applying to university has fallen below the UK average, possibly due to the high costs associated with higher education.  In summary, students like Jordan are facing financial challenges while pursuing their education. They are seeking part-time work, utilizing university resources, and exploring various ways to save money. However, the high cost of living remains a significant barrier for many students, potentially impacting their decision to pursue higher education.</p>

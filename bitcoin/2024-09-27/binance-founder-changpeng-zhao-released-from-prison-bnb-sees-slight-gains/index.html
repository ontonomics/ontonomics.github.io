    <p> Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was released from prison on Friday after serving a four-month sentence for violating US anti-money laundering laws. CZ, who was sentenced in April and had to pay a $50 million fine, walked away with a personal fortune of over $60 billion. His release has sparked speculation about potential impacts on the cryptocurrency market, particularly Binance Coin (BNB), which saw nearly 7% gains in the past 24 hours.  Despite no longer serving as CEO of Binance, Zhao s influence is expected to stabilize or even boost the crypto market. Analysts suggest that his continued presence as a major figure among investors could have a positive effect.  In other news, Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm is set to face a court trial after Judge Katherine Polk Failla refused to dismiss his case. Storm and Roman Semenov, the founders of Tornado Cash, were accused of laundering $1 billion in August 2023 and supporting the Lazarus Group in laundering hundreds of millions of US Dollars through the crypto-mixing platform.  The Social Capital Markets team s recent study reveals a significant increase in crypto-related convictions, with a 267% growth in the last five years and a 300% growth in convictions over the last decade. The report highlights the success of the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DoJ) in prosecuting crypto-related crimes. The increase in convictions underscores the ongoing crackdown on the crypto industry.</p>

    <p> PayPal has streamlined its payments technology through artificial intelligence, addressing CEO Alex Chriss s concerns about an unclear focus. The company is rapidly deploying its new Fastlane checkout system to retailers using Adobe Commerce s Magento platform, in partnership with checkout technology company Bold Commerce. This collaboration allows Magento retailers to integrate PayPal s Fastlane in about 30 minutes without upgrading their technology, reaching approximately 137,000 merchants.  Fastlane, launched earlier this year, is an online checkout system that enables consumers to make payments with a one-time passcode in a few taps. It uses AI-powered analysis to recommend checkout options based on past payment choices, aiming to boost conversion rates as PayPal refocuses on its core payments businesses.  Despite having nearly 400 million active accounts, PayPal is relying on partnerships with other merchant-facing firms to quickly introduce Fastlane and other new products to the market. The company has also partnered with payment company BVNK to reach corporate users for its stablecoin, part of PayPal s growing crypto strategy.  Other partnerships include Fiserv and Adyen, which make PayPal s technology available to international networks with thousands of merchants. The focus on conversion rates during online checkout is a key priority for merchants, as cart abandonment remains a significant issue.  PayPal s recovery strategy, which involves de-emphasizing non-core services like logistics technology, is showing signs of progress. The company s stock has rebounded to about $80, and its most recent earnings exceeded analysts  projections. Analysts at Seeking Alpha have noted that PayPal s new management is effectively executing its strategies, with the turnaround appearing to be in its early stages.</p>

  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to today&rsquo;s edition of the Daily Bitcoin Digest. Here, we bring you the latest news from the world of cryptocurrency. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just starting, we&rsquo;ve got you covered.
Recently, the cryptocurrency market has shown mixed results. Huobi Token (HT) jumped by 15.3% in one day and is now worth $0.59. This token, launched in 2018 on the Ethereum blockchain, offers benefits like fee discounts and voting rights on the Huobi Global exchange.
Litecoin (LTC), created in 2011, saw a small rise of 0.3% in the past 24 hours and is now priced at $70.10. Litecoin is known for its fast and low-cost internet payments and aims to improve on Bitcoin&rsquo;s limitations.
Stratis (STRAX) also increased by 2.8% against the USD and is now trading at $0.0547. Stratis supports blockchain apps via the .NET framework and is used for staking, transaction fees, and smart contracts.
OriginTrail (TRAC) saw a 0.7% increase and is now trading at $0.59. This ERC-20 token is used for compensation, staking, and governance on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network.
ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) had a big 29.2% increase in one day, with a 67.4% rise over the past week. This token operates on the Arbitrum platform and has gained a lot of attention since its launch in April 2023.
Analysts expect the altcoin market to grow, predicting big price increases for Cardano (ADA) and DTX Exchange (DTX). Cardano could see a 1,200% rise, while DTX Exchange might increase by 1,000%. Turkey&rsquo;s Garanti BBVA bank has added Ripple (XRP) to its mobile app, showing growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, recently unlocked its community treasury but saw no big price change. Analysts predict a decline if investors move to better-performing exchanges. Lunex Network, a new DeFi protocol, is gaining attention with features like instant cross-blockchain swaps and low fees.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned against illegal fund management activities. They are working with the Nigerian Police and the Federal Ministry of Justice to enforce the law. The SEC aims to educate and protect investors, raising financial literacy and awareness of investment opportunities.
The FBI handled over 100,000 fraud cases involving people over 60 in 2023, with losses over $3.4 billion. Common scams include romance, grandparent, government impersonation, and cryptocurrency fraud. To protect yourself, use strong passwords, secure personal information, and keep software updated.

  <meta name="description" content=" Quantum computing, while not yet a common topic in American households or fully operational, is rapidly advancing and nearing practical application. Analysts from McKinsey predict that around 5,000 quantum computers will be functional by 2030. Major banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and HSBC are actively exploring the potential of quantum computing to enhance application speeds, reduce bottlenecks, safeguard digital assets, and achieve high-performance computing with minimal energy use. They view this investment as a strategic move to gain a competitive edge when quantum computing becomes widely accessible.  Marco Pistoia, the head of global technology applied research at JPMorgan Chase, emphasizes the importance of this pivotal moment. He stresses the need for investment in building a quantum team, as quantum computing is still in the research and development (R&amp;D) phase due to the current limitations of quantum computers. However, he advocates for preparing for quantum readiness now, as the technology is expected to become more powerful and applicable in the near future.  In summary, while quantum computing is not yet ready for everyday use, its progress is accelerating, and major financial institutions are investing in its potential to revolutionize various aspects of computing. The focus on building a quantum team and preparing for its eventual practical application is seen as a crucial step in maintaining a competitive advantage in the evolving technological landscape."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-09-30/baas-pullouts-trump-crypto-top-tech-news-september-2024/">

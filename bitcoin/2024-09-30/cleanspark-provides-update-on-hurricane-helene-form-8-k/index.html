  <meta name="description" content=" CleanSpark Inc., a leading Bitcoin miner, has provided an update on the impact of Hurricane Helene. The company extends its deepest condolences to the affected communities and individuals, acknowledging the loss of life and the challenges faced by those without power and basic necessities.  The company s employees and their families in rural Georgia, where CleanSpark operates, have shown remarkable resilience in supporting one another during this crisis. CleanSpark s teams have collaborated with local utilities to restore power to affected regions, demonstrating their commitment to the community.  Despite the hurricane s impact, CleanSpark s geographically diverse portfolio of sites allowed it to maintain approximately 10.5 EH/s at its sites in Northwest Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee. To ensure health and safety and avoid undue pressure on the electrical grid, the company shut down 365 MW of its Southeast Georgia sites as the hurricane began impacting the region.  Since then, CleanSpark has been in regular communication with local utilities to safely bring the sites back online. Within 24 hours, the company was able to bring hashrate back to over 17.5 EH/s, and approximately 200 MW has been restored. The remaining 165 MW is expected to be online in the coming week, with the majority of the sites experiencing no material damage.  CleanSpark s CEO, Zach Bradford, expresses gratitude to the company s teams for their resilience and dedication during this challenging time. The company continues to move forward and achieve its goals, thanks to the efforts of its employees.  About CleanSpark: CleanSpark (Nasdaq: CLSK) is America s Bitcoin Miner®. The company owns and operates multiple data centers that primarily run on low-carbon power. CleanSpark supports Bitcoin, an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion, while cultivating trust and transparency among its employees and the communities it operates in.

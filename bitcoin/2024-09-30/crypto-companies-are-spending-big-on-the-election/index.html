  <meta name="description" content=" Crypto companies are heavily investing in the 2024 election cycle, with nearly half of all corporate spending on this year s federal elections coming from crypto backers. This spending is directed towards both Democrats and Republicans, with both presidential candidates seeking to attract the crypto vote. Former President Donald Trump is particularly popular among crypto companies due to his previous skepticism towards cryptocurrencies and his promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.  The crypto industry is unhappy with the Biden administration s regulations and enforcement actions, which they perceive as unclear and overly harsh. Joe McCann, an investor in a crypto fund, argues that these regulations are causing pain for entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors in the space.  On the other hand, the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, has been less specific about her stance on cryptocurrencies compared to Trump. However, she has released a policy document promising to encourage this technology while also protecting consumers and investors.  Overall, crypto companies are hoping that the next president will be more favorable towards the industry, regardless of the election outcome.

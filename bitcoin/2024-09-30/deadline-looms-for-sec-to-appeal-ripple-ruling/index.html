  <meta name="description" content=" Shah Gilani, Chief Investment Strategist at Money Map Press, discusses the potential appeal by the SEC against a ruling from U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, which deemed only some of Ripple s XRP token sales as violating securities laws. The SEC, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, is determined to assert jurisdiction over the $2 trillion crypto industry and avoid a dual system of disclosure. Gilani believes the SEC will appeal, as the ruling could undermine the disclosure mandate of securities laws.  The ruling has been a significant legal victory for the crypto industry, which seeks to prove that it is not in violation of U.S. securities laws. It has also become a cornerstone in the legal strategies of other crypto entities like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, which are currently sued by the SEC for allegedly selling unregistered securities.  The SEC s potential appeal is seen as a waste of resources by some legal minds representing the crypto industry, as the case involves a fixed set of facts and circumstances that deal with more than just programmatic sales of XRP. They argue that the Coinbase and Binance cases are more relevant to the current enforcement priorities and will address secondary sales in a more direct way.  Despite the controversy surrounding the ruling, Gilani remains optimistic about the future of U.S. crypto regulation and has invested in Coinbase, believing that the SEC s appeal will ultimately benefit the industry.  In summary, the SEC s potential appeal against Judge Torres  ruling on Ripple s XRP token sales has sparked debate within the crypto industry. While some legal experts believe the appeal is a waste of resources, others argue that it is necessary to address the broader issue of secondary sales in crypto exchanges. Gilani, however, sees the appeal as a positive step towards establishing clear regulations for the crypto industry."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-09-30/deadline-looms-for-sec-to-appeal-ripple-ruling/">

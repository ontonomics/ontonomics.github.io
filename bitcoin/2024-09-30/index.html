  <meta name="description" content="Bitcoin and Beyond: Today&rsquo;s Crypto Landscape
Bitcoin is changing how we handle money. It&rsquo;s important to know what&rsquo;s new with Bitcoin to keep up. Knowing how Bitcoin works can help you understand this digital world better.
Young people today care a lot about digital assets like Bitcoin. They also care about social causes. They use online tools to manage their money. This shows they want to be independent and smart about money. Because of this, experts need to learn new skills and use new tools.
In Singapore, companies that deal with digital money have new rules to follow. These rules started in October 2023 and will be fully in place by June 2025. They include keeping customer money safe and giving clear information about risks. The goal is to protect people who use these services.
The U.S. government is deciding if it will appeal a court decision about Ripple, a company that uses cryptocurrency. The court said some of Ripple&rsquo;s actions broke the law. This decision is important for the whole crypto industry. The government might appeal, which could affect other big crypto companies like Coinbase and Binance.
Crypto companies are spending a lot of money on the 2024 election. They are unhappy with the current government&rsquo;s rules. They are supporting both Democrats and Republicans, but they like Donald Trump the most. Trump used to not like Bitcoin but now wants to make the U.S. a leader in crypto. Kamala Harris also supports crypto but is less clear about her plans. The industry hopes for better rules after the election.
China&rsquo;s economy is slowing down, so people are turning to Bitcoin. Even with some restrictions, China is still a big player in Bitcoin mining. This change might make Bitcoin more popular in China.
Crypto Fest 2024, called &ldquo;Cryptopia,&rdquo; will be in Cape Town from October 10-12. People from around the world will come to talk about cryptocurrency and new technologies. There will be workshops, exhibitions, and networking events. This is a big event for anyone interested in blockchain and cryptocurrency.
Many companies are creating new crypto products. One U.S. company lets stores buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency. Another company made a Tokenized Asset Platform for banks. But the industry faces security problems, like the recent $43 million hack of BingX.
CleanSpark Inc. shared news about Hurricane Helene. All their workers are safe, and their buildings are fine. They shut down some sites in Georgia to avoid hurting the power grid but kept other sites running. This shows how important strong systems are in crypto mining.
Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are top blockchains, but a new project called RCO Finance (RCOF) might do even better by early 2025. RCOF uses AI for trading, which is good for both new and experienced traders. Experts think its value will go up a lot, making it a great investment for 2024.
Keeping up with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is important. There are always new rules, political changes, and technologies. Knowing about these can help you understand the future of digital money. Your journey into the digital financial world starts now.

    <br/> Quantum computing, while not yet a common topic in American households or fully operational, is rapidly advancing and nearing practical application. Analysts from McKinsey predict that around 5,000 quantum computers will be functional by 2030. Major banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and HSBC are actively exploring the potential of quantum computing to enhance application speeds, reduce bottlenecks, safeguard digital assets, and achieve high-performance computing with minimal energy use. They view this investment as a strategic move to gain a competitive edge when quantum computing becomes widely accessible.  Marco Pistoia, the head of global technology applied research at JPMorgan Chase, emphasizes the importance of this pivotal moment. He stresses the need for investment in building a quantum team, as quantum computing is still in the research and development (R&amp;D) phase due to the current limitations of quantum computers. However, he advocates for preparing for quantum readiness now, as the technology is expected to become more powerful and applicable in the near future.  In summary, while quantum computing is not yet ready for everyday use, its progress is accelerating, and major financial institutions are investing in its potential to revolutionize various aspects of computing. The focus on building a quantum team and preparing for its eventual practical application is seen as a crucial step in maintaining a competitive advantage in the evolving technological landscape.

    <br/> In Batman #153, written by Chip Zdarsky and illustrated by Jorge Jiménez, Gotham City experiences a decrease in crime due to social programs funded by Wayne Enterprises. Despite this, Batman remains uneasy as many of his adversaries have escaped Arkham Asylum. The Riddler, Edward Nygma, stands out as he seeks attention in a legal manner, with Bruce Wayne s tentative support. Nygma has established a security firm, NygmaTech, and has made millions by investing in cryptocurrency. This venture is not his first attempt at redemption; he has previously worked as a private investigator and even licensed his Riddler persona as a toys and games spokesperson.  Despite the questionable nature of cryptocurrency, Batman hopes that Nygma will continue on his path of rehabilitation. For now, the Riddler contributes positively to Gotham City by creating job opportunities. Batman #153 is set to be released in comic shops on October 2, 2024.

    <br/> California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed SB 1047, a bill that would have imposed restrictions on AI development in the U.S., citing concerns that it could give a false sense of security and potentially hinder AI innovation. The Biden administration has been working on AI regulation, with an executive action in October 2023 outlining core tenets and voluntary commitments from companies for safe AI development.  White House Special Advisor on AI, Ben Buchanan, emphasized the importance of balancing AI policies to protect privacy, workers, and civil rights while fostering innovation. The administration is pushing for more AI content labeling to mitigate disinformation risks, such as deepfakes.  From a national security perspective, the U.S. sees China as its primary competitor in AI. The U.S. aims to maintain leadership in AI, including chip design and data center assembly. Buchanan believes the U.S. energy grid can support AI growth, and the Biden administration has convened a meeting to discuss this issue.  The intelligence community warned of AI s potential use by China, Russia, and Iran to influence elections. Buchanan stressed the importance of labeling AI and non-AI content to inform the public. President Biden highlighted AI s impact on warfare, emphasizing the need for clear guidance on using AI in military strategy while retaining human control.  Overall, the U.S. is working to establish responsible AI policies that balance innovation with ethical considerations and national security.

    <br/> CleanSpark Inc., a leading Bitcoin miner, has provided an update on the impact of Hurricane Helene. The company extends its deepest condolences to the affected communities and individuals, acknowledging the loss of life and the challenges faced by those without power and basic necessities.  The company s employees and their families in rural Georgia, where CleanSpark operates, have shown remarkable resilience in supporting one another during this crisis. CleanSpark s teams have collaborated with local utilities to restore power to affected regions, demonstrating their commitment to the community.  Despite the hurricane s impact, CleanSpark s geographically diverse portfolio of sites allowed it to maintain approximately 10.5 EH/s at its sites in Northwest Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee. To ensure health and safety and avoid undue pressure on the electrical grid, the company shut down 365 MW of its Southeast Georgia sites as the hurricane began impacting the region.  Since then, CleanSpark has been in regular communication with local utilities to safely bring the sites back online. Within 24 hours, the company was able to bring hashrate back to over 17.5 EH/s, and approximately 200 MW has been restored. The remaining 165 MW is expected to be online in the coming week, with the majority of the sites experiencing no material damage.  CleanSpark s CEO, Zach Bradford, expresses gratitude to the company s teams for their resilience and dedication during this challenging time. The company continues to move forward and achieve its goals, thanks to the efforts of its employees.  About CleanSpark: CleanSpark (Nasdaq: CLSK) is America s Bitcoin Miner®. The company owns and operates multiple data centers that primarily run on low-carbon power. CleanSpark supports Bitcoin, an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion, while cultivating trust and transparency among its employees and the communities it operates in.

    <br/> Coin Center, a prominent crypto think tank, is undergoing a restructuring of its senior leadership as announced by its executive director, Jerry Brito. Brito, along with Robin Weisman, the senior policy counsel at the non-profit organization, will be stepping down from their current roles by the end of the year. Despite their departure, both Brito and Weisman will continue to be associated with the organization.  This leadership change comes amidst the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Coin Center, known for its research and advocacy in the crypto space, has been at the forefront of shaping policies and regulations related to digital currencies. The departure of its key personnel marks a significant shift in the organization s direction and could potentially impact its future initiatives and strategies.  The restructuring of the senior leadership at Coin Center is a reflection of the dynamic nature of the crypto industry. As the sector continues to grow and mature, organizations like Coin Center must adapt and evolve to remain relevant and effective in their advocacy efforts. The departure of Brito and Weisman may pave the way for new perspectives and approaches to address the challenges and opportunities in the crypto space.  In conclusion, Coin Center s decision to restructure its senior leadership signifies the organization s commitment to staying abreast of the rapidly changing crypto landscape. While the departure of its key personnel may bring about some uncertainty, it also presents an opportunity for fresh ideas and innovative strategies to drive the organization s mission forward. The future of Coin Center and its role in shaping the crypto industry remains to be seen as it navigates through this period of change.

    <br/> Crypto companies are heavily investing in the 2024 election cycle, with nearly half of all corporate spending on this year s federal elections coming from crypto backers. This spending is directed towards both Democrats and Republicans, with both presidential candidates seeking to attract the crypto vote. Former President Donald Trump is particularly popular among crypto companies due to his previous skepticism towards cryptocurrencies and his promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.  The crypto industry is unhappy with the Biden administration s regulations and enforcement actions, which they perceive as unclear and overly harsh. Joe McCann, an investor in a crypto fund, argues that these regulations are causing pain for entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors in the space.  On the other hand, the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, has been less specific about her stance on cryptocurrencies compared to Trump. However, she has released a policy document promising to encourage this technology while also protecting consumers and investors.  Overall, crypto companies are hoping that the next president will be more favorable towards the industry, regardless of the election outcome.

    <br/> The legislative calendar s shrinkage and the aftermath of the November elections are likely to hinder lawmakers  attempts to pass cryptocurrency legislation in the current year. However, the industry s need for legal clarity and a renewed push from investors and some lawmakers offer hope for progress in the following year.  Former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have shown support for digital assets, with the GOP s platform at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee highlighting crypto innovation and opposing a central bank digital currency. Democrats  stance on the industry has been evolving, with Vice President Harris and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer signaling industry support. However, some Democrats, including Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, remain opposed to greater adoption of digital assets.  Despite the uncertainty surrounding congressional action, individual lawmakers are laying the groundwork for future legislation. Several industry-related bills have been introduced in Congress, and other draft legislation is circulating on the Hill. These measures aim to define the legal status of digital assets and expand regulatory frameworks, such as the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money-laundering, and know-your-customer regimes, to the crypto industry.  The  Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act,  introduced by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn  GT  Thompson and Reps. French Hill and Dusty Johnson, passed the House on a bipartisan vote in May. It would grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jurisdiction over digital commodities and clarify the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) jurisdiction over digital assets offered as part of an investment contract.  The outcome of the November elections will provide some legislative and regulatory clarity for the industry. If Trump wins, the SEC and CFTC will have new leaders, potentially affecting crypto policy. If Harris wins, SEC Chair Gary Gensler and CFTC Chair Rostin Benham could remain in their posts, leaving the regulatory and enforcement environment uncertain.

    <a href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-09-30/deadline-looms-for-sec-to-appeal-ripple-ruling/">Deadline looms for SEC to appeal Ripple ruling</a>
    <br/> Shah Gilani, Chief Investment Strategist at Money Map Press, discusses the potential appeal by the SEC against a ruling from U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, which deemed only some of Ripple s XRP token sales as violating securities laws. The SEC, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, is determined to assert jurisdiction over the $2 trillion crypto industry and avoid a dual system of disclosure. Gilani believes the SEC will appeal, as the ruling could undermine the disclosure mandate of securities laws.  The ruling has been a significant legal victory for the crypto industry, which seeks to prove that it is not in violation of U.S. securities laws. It has also become a cornerstone in the legal strategies of other crypto entities like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, which are currently sued by the SEC for allegedly selling unregistered securities.  The SEC s potential appeal is seen as a waste of resources by some legal minds representing the crypto industry, as the case involves a fixed set of facts and circumstances that deal with more than just programmatic sales of XRP. They argue that the Coinbase and Binance cases are more relevant to the current enforcement priorities and will address secondary sales in a more direct way.  Despite the controversy surrounding the ruling, Gilani remains optimistic about the future of U.S. crypto regulation and has invested in Coinbase, believing that the SEC s appeal will ultimately benefit the industry.  In summary, the SEC s potential appeal against Judge Torres  ruling on Ripple s XRP token sales has sparked debate within the crypto industry. While some legal experts believe the appeal is a waste of resources, others argue that it is necessary to address the broader issue of secondary sales in crypto exchanges. Gilani, however, sees the appeal as a positive step towards establishing clear regulations for the crypto industry.

    <br/> The future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States may depend on a critical decision by the SEC, the primary financial regulatory body, regarding whether to appeal a significant legal ruling against Ripple, a leading blockchain payments company. The SEC has a deadline of October 7 to determine its course of action.  This legal battle between the SEC and Ripple has garnered considerable attention, as it could set a precedent for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the U.S. The outcome of this case could influence how the SEC approaches similar cases in the future, potentially shaping the landscape of crypto regulation.  The SEC s decision to appeal or not will have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry, as it will signal the agency s stance on the legal status of cryptocurrencies and their associated technologies. If the SEC chooses to appeal, it could lead to a prolonged legal process, creating uncertainty for crypto businesses and investors. On the other hand, if the SEC decides not to appeal, it may indicate a more accommodating approach to the burgeoning crypto market.  In either scenario, the decision will likely impact the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. It could also influence the SEC s future actions and collaborations with other regulatory bodies, both domestically and internationally.  As the October 7 deadline approaches, the crypto community and industry stakeholders are closely monitoring the situation, understanding that the SEC s decision will have a significant impact on the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.

    <br/> In 2024, cryptocurrencies have seen a rebound, prompting some traders to consider selling their digital assets. However, before proceeding, it s crucial to understand the tax implications, as capital gains may result in significant tax liabilities. Here are five methods to cash out your cryptocurrency or Bitcoin:  1. Use a centralized exchange: Platforms like Coinbase offer a straightforward  buy/sell  feature, allowing traders to exchange their cryptocurrency for cash. The cash can then be transferred to a bank account. It s recommended to use the exchange that holds your coins if you don t have custody of them.  2. Utilize your broker: If your broker holds your cryptocurrency, executing a trade on their platform is the simplest way to sell. After the trade, the cash will be available in your account for further trading.  3. Peer-to-peer trade: Sellers can find the best offers through online platforms like Binance P2P or Paxful. These platforms facilitate direct trades, with the seller s crypto being escrowed until the buyer confirms receipt of the funds.  4. Cash out at a Bitcoin ATM: Companies like Hermes Bitcoin offer immediate access to cash by using a QR code to send your Bitcoin. However, the high commissions associated with these transactions should be considered.  5. Trade one crypto for another and then cash out: Some exchanges may not allow direct conversion to dollars, necessitating an indirect route. This may involve transferring or converting your cryptocurrency to a stablecoin like Tether before converting to dollars.  In conclusion, traders have multiple options to sell their cryptocurrency, ranging from centralized exchanges to peer-to-peer trades. However, it s essential to consider the tax implications of selling digital assets. Bankrate s Logan Jacoby and former Bankrate reporter Georgina Tzanetos contributed to this article.

His age is compared to biblical figures, with Carter s centennial seeming more like a bar mitzvah. Adam, the world s first human, lived until 930, setting a high bar for longevity. However, after the flood in biblical times, lifespans significantly decreased. Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar suggests that God shortened human lifespans to force a sense of urgency and purpose in life. Carter, who entered hospice in February 2023, is already in his 20th month, a biblical feat.

    <br/> Singapore s digital asset firms, including those offering digital payment token (DPT) services, will be subject to new regulations aimed at protecting retail consumers. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has outlined two phases for these rules to be implemented, with the first phase taking effect on October 4 and the second on June 19, 2025.  In the initial phase, firms must adhere to measures related to ring-fencing customer assets, disclosures, and risk management controls. Additionally, they are prohibited from offering incentives to attract retail customers. The latter rule is particularly relevant given the high volatility of cryptocurrency prices.  The second phase, effective in June 2025, further restricts crypto firms from using credit, leverage, or derivatives contracts referencing cryptocurrencies as underlying assets for retail investors.  These regulations apply to all retail customers, regardless of their residency. Crypto firms must conduct a risk awareness assessment for existing retail customers before June 19, 2025, unless specific circumstances allow for an exemption.  The updated guidelines, which fall under the Payment Services Act, were introduced in January 2020 to address anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism risks associated with DPTs. The new measures aim to enhance consumer protection and ensure that crypto and DPT businesses implement stronger safeguards and controls.  The earlier safeguarding requirements, set to be implemented in October, are designed to protect customer assets in cases of fraud or insolvency. This move by the MAS demonstrates a commitment to ensuring a safer environment for retail investors in the rapidly evolving digital asset industry.

    <br/> The Ramapo Police Department in New York is seeking public assistance in solving the unsolved murder of Helen Soudani, a young mother found strangled in 1977 inside The Aegean Grotto, a family restaurant located in the former Ramapo Shopping Center on Route 59. Soudani s husband, Moutz Soudani, previously gained attention when he reenacted his theory of her murder, but he was arrested last week on a separate charge of allegedly bribing a senior Orange County prosecutor to investigate his nephew for a cryptocurrency theft.  The prosecutor, Stewart Rosenwasser, died following a shootout with the FBI at his home after resigning in June. The Ramapo Police Department s Detective Division is accepting tips on the case at 845-357-2400, and anonymous tips can be submitted through the Rockland District Attorney s Office Tip41 app. The public s help is crucial in bringing closure to this cold case that has remained unsolved for nearly five decades.

    <br/> Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have been the top blockchains this year, with Solana leading the memecoin rally and being the preferred platform for new launches. However, RCO Finance (RCOF) is predicted to surpass both ETH and SOL by Q1 2025 due to its unique features and potential for massive adoption.  ETH has struggled to make significant moves this year, with investors cashing in on high gas fees and moving to other chains like Solana. Despite a recent increase in value, experts believe ETH won t be the main focus in the upcoming AI boom.  Solana, on the other hand, is expected to outpace ETH but still fall short of RCOF. Its cheaper gas fees and ability to capture the memecoin market make it a strong contender. However, RCOF s AI trading platform, RCO Finance, offers unprecedented opportunities for both beginners and professionals, with its AI robo advisor fully automating trading strategies.  RCOF, the native token of RCO Finance, is set to benefit from the platform s success. Currently in Stage 2 of its public presale, RCOF is expected to reach $5 by Q1 2025, offering investors a potential 16,500% ROI. Experts believe that RCOF s value will continue to grow as more people realize the benefits of using RCO Finance in the crypto market.  In conclusion, while ETH and Solana have their strengths, RCO Finance and its native token RCOF are poised to outperform them by Q1 2025 due to their unique features, potential for massive adoption, and the upcoming AI boom. Investors looking for a promising crypto investment in 2024 should consider RCOF.

    <br/> Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has issued a subpoena to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for records related to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz s connections to China. This action follows a whistleblower s tip-off about a non-classified Microsoft Teams group chat among DHS employees and additional intelligence reports, which allegedly contain information about Walz s alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  The whistleblower disclosures revealed a longstanding connection between the CCP and Walz, including his involvement as a visiting fellow at the CCP-sanctioned Macau Polytechnic University until at least 2007. Additionally, Walz was connected to the Chinese People s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, which the United States cut ties with in 2019 due to accusations of malignly influencing state and local leaders.  The DHS is expected to stall a response to the subpoena to keep any potentially embarrassing information about Walz s connections to China out of the public domain until after the upcoming VP debate. This development may lead to awkward exchanges during the debate, as Walz s ties to China and the CCP are brought into question.  In summary, Rep. Comer s subpoena to the DHS aims to uncover any hidden connections between Tim Walz and China, following whistleblower disclosures. The information obtained could potentially impact the VP debate and shed light on Walz s involvement with Chinese organizations and the CCP. The DHS s response to the subpoena is expected to be delayed, keeping any sensitive information under wraps until after the election.

    <br/> The U.S. stock market experienced fluctuations following Federal Reserve Chairman Powell s speech, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq composite index all experiencing drops ahead of and shortly after the speech. Despite Powell s assurance that the economy is in solid shape, the major U.S. indexes saw declines, with the Dow closing just above its Friday record. However, within a few hours, the indexes rebounded, with the Nasdaq closing up 0.38% and the S&amp;P 500 rising 0.42%, setting a new record.  In Europe, stocks fell from record highs, with the STOXX Europe 600 closing down 0.98%. The decline was led by a 12% drop in Stellantis, a Jeep- and Ram-maker, due to weaker-than-expected sales and increased competition from China.  China s stock market saw an 8.06% gain, driven by stimulus measures and rate cuts on existing mortgages announced by the central bank.  In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 4.8% amid investor concerns over incoming Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba s potential support for raising interest rates. This move could strengthen the yen and make Japanese exports less competitive, causing automakers Honda, Toyota, and Mazda to drop more than 7%.  Bitcoin also experienced a decline, with its value dropping by 3.05% to $63,651.50.  Overall, the global stock markets experienced mixed results, with some countries seeing gains due to stimulus measures and others facing declines due to economic uncertainties and potential policy changes.

    <br/> Former President Donald Trump has announced his new crypto platform, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), targeting accredited investors in the U.S. and eligible investors globally. Despite Trump s previous skepticism towards cryptocurrency, his latest venture has sparked controversy and criticism within the crypto community.  Many crypto enthusiasts, who appreciate the pseudonymity and lack of regulation in the space, are dismayed by the stringent eligibility requirements for WLFI s whitelist. To join, individuals must verify their identity, pass an Accredited Investor Verification Method, and earn more than $100,000 annually. This has led to concerns that the platform may not truly embody the decentralized finance (DeFi) principles it claims to uphold.  Critics argue that WLFI s launch could potentially damage Trump s electoral prospects, especially if the platform becomes a target for hackers or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some crypto influencers have called for collective action to prevent the launch of World Liberty Coin, citing concerns about legal trouble and reputational damage.  Despite the backlash, Trump has shown a strong interest in cryptocurrency, particularly due to his youngest son Barron s knowledge of the subject. Trump s embrace of crypto technology has shifted from his earlier warnings of potential disasters.  In summary, Trump s new crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, has raised eyebrows and concerns within the crypto community due to its stringent eligibility requirements and potential implications for Trump s political future. Critics argue that the platform may not align with the decentralized finance principles and could face legal and reputational challenges.

    <br/> World Liberty Financial, associated with former President Donald Trump and his associates, has made claims about its potential to revolutionize cryptocurrency and liberate average Americans from traditional financial institutions. However, the company has not provided detailed information on how it intends to achieve this. The platform is now accepting signups from US-based accredited investors and non-US persons for the know-your-customer (KYC) verification process.  World Liberty Financial aims to drive mass adoption of stable coins and decentralized finance, with plans to distribute governance tokens called WLFI. The project is built on the Ethereum blockchain and Aave, a decentralized finance platform, and focuses on a credit account system. The company s whitepaper reveals that 70% of WLFI tokens will be held by the founding members, team, and service providers, contrary to previous reports of 63%.  The company blames outdated US policies for limiting whitelists to accredited investors and non-US persons. The SEC defines accredited investors as individuals with a net worth of at least $1 million or an annual income of $200,000 or $300,000 for two years. As of 2022, around 24 million American households qualified as accredited investors, representing nearly 20% of US households.  Despite these details, World Liberty Financial has not provided a clear explanation of its services or how it will help unbanked and underserved communities. The company s website states that additional information will only be available to pre-qualified individuals who have completed the KYC process.  In summary, World Liberty Financial, associated with Donald Trump and his associates, has made promises about its cryptocurrency platform s potential to revolutionize finance. However, the company has not provided sufficient details on its services or how it will benefit the average American. The platform is now accepting signups from accredited investors and non-US persons for the KYC verification process.

Vance VP Debate Betting Odds , What Candidate Is Favored ? Plus , How To Watch , Likely Topics And More - Paramount Global ( NASDAQ : PARA ) </a>
    <br/> The upcoming vice presidential debate on Oct. 1 between Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Ohio Senator J.D. Vance will focus on key issues such as abortion, border control, inflation, and recent events like Hurricane Helene and the situation in Israel. The debate will be hosted by CBS News and moderated by Norah O Donnell and Margaret Brennan. Unlike the recent presidential debate, the candidates will have microphones that are not muted.  The debate will last 90 minutes with two four-minute commercial breaks, during which candidates won t interact with their campaign teams. Walz will be on the left side of the stage, and Vance on the right. The candidates will be given questions and allowed two minutes to answer and respond, with one minute for rebuttals.  Undecided voters and those less convinced about Harris or Trump may find this debate crucial. The betting odds from Polymarket suggest that Vance will mention Trump and Harris more frequently than Walz. Topics like  tampon  and  Haitian  are also likely to be discussed.  Betting odds predict that Walz will win the debate based on YouGov polls, with a 73% chance of victory. The number of viewers is also a point of interest, with odds ranging from less than 40 million to 65 million or more.  The debate s outcome could potentially affect the betting odds for the 2024 election, with current odds showing a 50% chance of victory for Harris compared to 49% for Trump. The debate will be available for streaming on Paramount&#43;, CBSNews.com, and YouTube, with simulcasting options for other networks.

    <br/> A U.S. payments and financial technology company has announced that it will allow its U.S. merchants to directly engage in cryptocurrency transactions, following a successful launch for retail customers. This move caters to business owners  demand for similar cryptocurrency capabilities. The company s business account clients will also be able to send and receive cryptocurrency tokens to and from external blockchain addresses.  Meanwhile, a global payments technology company has launched its Tokenized Asset Platform to assist banks in issuing fiat-backed tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform provides tools and infrastructure for tokenizing fiat currencies and potentially trading real-world assets like commodities and bonds.  In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the cryptocurrency market saw an estimated $338.7 billion in on-chain value during the year from July 2023 to July 2024, making it the seventh-largest market globally in 2024. While centralized exchanges remain the primary source of inflows, decentralized platforms and DeFi applications are gaining traction. Stablecoins and altcoins are increasing their market share at the expense of traditionally favored assets like bitcoin and ether.  In regulatory news, the SEC has charged two entities for fraudulent and unregistered sales of investment contracts involving TUSD, a stablecoin. The SEC alleges that the defendants misrepresented the investment opportunity, exposing investors to substantial undisclosed risks. Both defendants have agreed to an injunction against further violations and have paid a fine and disgorgement.  The CFTC has also taken action against four entities for failure to register as futures commission merchants (FCMs) and for falsely claiming to be registered. The CFTC urges the public to verify CFTC registration status before committing funds.  Lastly, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has taken steps to disrupt Russian cybercrime services, identifying PM2BTC as a primary money laundering concern and sanctioning its operators. The DOJ has charged two individuals with

  <meta name="description" content=" Singapore s digital asset firms, including those offering digital payment token (DPT) services, will be subject to new regulations aimed at protecting retail consumers. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has outlined two phases for these rules to be implemented, with the first phase taking effect on October 4 and the second on June 19, 2025.  In the initial phase, firms must adhere to measures related to ring-fencing customer assets, disclosures, and risk management controls. Additionally, they are prohibited from offering incentives to attract retail customers. The latter rule is particularly relevant given the high volatility of cryptocurrency prices.  The second phase, effective in June 2025, further restricts crypto firms from using credit, leverage, or derivatives contracts referencing cryptocurrencies as underlying assets for retail investors.  These regulations apply to all retail customers, regardless of their residency. Crypto firms must conduct a risk awareness assessment for existing retail customers before June 19, 2025, unless specific circumstances allow for an exemption.  The updated guidelines, which fall under the Payment Services Act, were introduced in January 2020 to address anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism risks associated with DPTs. The new measures aim to enhance consumer protection and ensure that crypto and DPT businesses implement stronger safeguards and controls.  The earlier safeguarding requirements, set to be implemented in October, are designed to protect customer assets in cases of fraud or insolvency. This move by the MAS demonstrates a commitment to ensuring a safer environment for retail investors in the rapidly evolving digital asset industry."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-09-30/more-spore-consumer-protection-rules-for-retail-crypto-investors-on-the-way/">

  <meta name="description" content=" Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has issued a subpoena to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for records related to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz s connections to China. This action follows a whistleblower s tip-off about a non-classified Microsoft Teams group chat among DHS employees and additional intelligence reports, which allegedly contain information about Walz s alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  The whistleblower disclosures revealed a longstanding connection between the CCP and Walz, including his involvement as a visiting fellow at the CCP-sanctioned Macau Polytechnic University until at least 2007. Additionally, Walz was connected to the Chinese People s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, which the United States cut ties with in 2019 due to accusations of malignly influencing state and local leaders.  The DHS is expected to stall a response to the subpoena to keep any potentially embarrassing information about Walz s connections to China out of the public domain until after the upcoming VP debate. This development may lead to awkward exchanges during the debate, as Walz s ties to China and the CCP are brought into question.  In summary, Rep. Comer s subpoena to the DHS aims to uncover any hidden connections between Tim Walz and China, following whistleblower disclosures. The information obtained could potentially impact the VP debate and shed light on Walz s involvement with Chinese organizations and the CCP. The DHS s response to the subpoena is expected to be delayed, keeping any sensitive information under wraps until after the election."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-09-30/rep-comer-issues-subpoena-for-dhs-records-on-tim-walz-ties-to-china/">

  <meta name="description" content=" The U.S. stock market experienced fluctuations following Federal Reserve Chairman Powell s speech, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq composite index all experiencing drops ahead of and shortly after the speech. Despite Powell s assurance that the economy is in solid shape, the major U.S. indexes saw declines, with the Dow closing just above its Friday record. However, within a few hours, the indexes rebounded, with the Nasdaq closing up 0.38% and the S&amp;P 500 rising 0.42%, setting a new record.  In Europe, stocks fell from record highs, with the STOXX Europe 600 closing down 0.98%. The decline was led by a 12% drop in Stellantis, a Jeep- and Ram-maker, due to weaker-than-expected sales and increased competition from China.  China s stock market saw an 8.06% gain, driven by stimulus measures and rate cuts on existing mortgages announced by the central bank.  In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 4.8% amid investor concerns over incoming Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba s potential support for raising interest rates. This move could strengthen the yen and make Japanese exports less competitive, causing automakers Honda, Toyota, and Mazda to drop more than 7%.  Bitcoin also experienced a decline, with its value dropping by 3.05% to $63,651.50.  Overall, the global stock markets experienced mixed results, with some countries seeing gains due to stimulus measures and others facing declines due to economic uncertainties and potential policy changes."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-09-30/stock-market-today-fresh-records-after-powell-rate-cut-remarks/">

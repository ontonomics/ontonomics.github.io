  <meta name="description" content=" Former President Donald Trump has announced his new crypto platform, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), targeting accredited investors in the U.S. and eligible investors globally. Despite Trump s previous skepticism towards cryptocurrency, his latest venture has sparked controversy and criticism within the crypto community.  Many crypto enthusiasts, who appreciate the pseudonymity and lack of regulation in the space, are dismayed by the stringent eligibility requirements for WLFI s whitelist. To join, individuals must verify their identity, pass an Accredited Investor Verification Method, and earn more than $100,000 annually. This has led to concerns that the platform may not truly embody the decentralized finance (DeFi) principles it claims to uphold.  Critics argue that WLFI s launch could potentially damage Trump s electoral prospects, especially if the platform becomes a target for hackers or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some crypto influencers have called for collective action to prevent the launch of World Liberty Coin, citing concerns about legal trouble and reputational damage.  Despite the backlash, Trump has shown a strong interest in cryptocurrency, particularly due to his youngest son Barron s knowledge of the subject. Trump s embrace of crypto technology has shifted from his earlier warnings of potential disasters.  In summary, Trump s new crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, has raised eyebrows and concerns within the crypto community due to its stringent eligibility requirements and potential implications for Trump s political future. Critics argue that the platform may not align with the decentralized finance principles and could face legal and reputational challenges."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-09-30/trump-crypto-platform-draws-doubts-head-of-election/">

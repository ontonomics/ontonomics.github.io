  <meta name="description" content=" World Liberty Financial, associated with former President Donald Trump and his associates, has made claims about its potential to revolutionize cryptocurrency and liberate average Americans from traditional financial institutions. However, the company has not provided detailed information on how it intends to achieve this. The platform is now accepting signups from US-based accredited investors and non-US persons for the know-your-customer (KYC) verification process.  World Liberty Financial aims to drive mass adoption of stable coins and decentralized finance, with plans to distribute governance tokens called WLFI. The project is built on the Ethereum blockchain and Aave, a decentralized finance platform, and focuses on a credit account system. The company s whitepaper reveals that 70% of WLFI tokens will be held by the founding members, team, and service providers, contrary to previous reports of 63%.  The company blames outdated US policies for limiting whitelists to accredited investors and non-US persons. The SEC defines accredited investors as individuals with a net worth of at least $1 million or an annual income of $200,000 or $300,000 for two years. As of 2022, around 24 million American households qualified as accredited investors, representing nearly 20% of US households.  Despite these details, World Liberty Financial has not provided a clear explanation of its services or how it will help unbanked and underserved communities. The company s website states that additional information will only be available to pre-qualified individuals who have completed the KYC process.  In summary, World Liberty Financial, associated with Donald Trump and his associates, has made promises about its cryptocurrency platform s potential to revolutionize finance. However, the company has not provided sufficient details on its services or how it will benefit the average American. The platform is now accepting signups from accredited investors and non-US persons for the KYC verification process."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-09-30/trump-crypto-platform-is-open-but-not-to-most-americans/">

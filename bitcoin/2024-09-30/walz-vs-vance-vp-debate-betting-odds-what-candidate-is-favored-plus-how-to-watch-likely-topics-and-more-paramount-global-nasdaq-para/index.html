  <meta name="description" content=" The upcoming vice presidential debate on Oct. 1 between Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Ohio Senator J.D. Vance will focus on key issues such as abortion, border control, inflation, and recent events like Hurricane Helene and the situation in Israel. The debate will be hosted by CBS News and moderated by Norah O Donnell and Margaret Brennan. Unlike the recent presidential debate, the candidates will have microphones that are not muted.  The debate will last 90 minutes with two four-minute commercial breaks, during which candidates won t interact with their campaign teams. Walz will be on the left side of the stage, and Vance on the right. The candidates will be given questions and allowed two minutes to answer and respond, with one minute for rebuttals.  Undecided voters and those less convinced about Harris or Trump may find this debate crucial. The betting odds from Polymarket suggest that Vance will mention Trump and Harris more frequently than Walz. Topics like  tampon  and  Haitian  are also likely to be discussed.  Betting odds predict that Walz will win the debate based on YouGov polls, with a 73% chance of victory. The number of viewers is also a point of interest, with odds ranging from less than 40 million to 65 million or more.  The debate s outcome could potentially affect the betting odds for the 2024 election, with current odds showing a 50% chance of victory for Harris compared to 49% for Trump. The debate will be available for streaming on Paramount&#43;, CBSNews.com, and YouTube, with simulcasting options for other networks."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-09-30/walz-vs-vance-vp-debate-betting-odds-what-candidate-is-favored-plus-how-to-watch-likely-topics-and-more-paramount-global-nasdaq-para/">

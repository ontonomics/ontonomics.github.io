  <meta name="description" content=" Amit Patel, a former financial manager for the Jacksonville Jaguars who stole $22 million from the team, is suing FanDuel for $250 million. Patel alleges that FanDuel exploited his gambling addiction, despite knowing he was an NFL employee ineligible to gamble legally. The lawsuit claims FanDuel provided Patel with over $1.1 million in gambling credits and bombarded him with gambling invitations, including up to 100 daily contacts from his personal host.  Patel s lawsuit attempts to distribute responsibility for his gambling addiction, highlighting FanDuel s active involvement. His lawyer, Matthew Litt, notes that the suit does not absolve the addicted gambler of blame but seeks to hold FanDuel accountable for its role in exacerbating Patel s addiction.  The lawsuit also details the lavish gifts FanDuel gave Patel, such as trips to various sporting events and concerts. Patel pleaded guilty to wire fraud and other charges, agreeing to repay the stolen money, which was used for sports memorabilia, country club membership, spa treatments, and more.  This case mirrors previous legal actions by compulsive gamblers who blamed casinos or online gambling companies for preying on their addictions. However, similar lawsuits have been dismissed in other states. FanDuel declined to comment on the pending litigation."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-01/ex-jaguars-employee-who-stole-from-team-sues-fanduel-for-250-million-for-exploiting-his-gambling-addiction/">

  <meta name="description" content=" Zishan Alvi, a 45-year-old co-owner of LabElite in Chicago, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud for his involvement in a COVID testing scam that generated over $83 million in fraudulent payments from the federal government s Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The scam, which took place from February 2021 to February 2022, involved billing the HRSA for COVID-19 tests that were either never performed or conducted with inadequate components, leading to false negative results.  Customers seeking testing at LabElite, sometimes for travel or contact with vulnerable individuals, received either no results or misleading negative results. The scam was uncovered when the FBI raided the Chicago testing site in February 2022. Alvi was indicted on 10 counts of wire fraud and one count of theft of government funds in March 2023.  The indictment listed Alvi s ill-gotten wealth, which included five luxury vehicles (a 2021 Mercedes-Benz, a 2021 Land Rover Range Rover HSE, a 2021 Lamborghini Urus, a 2021 Bentley, and a 2022 Tesla X), $810,000 in an E*Trade account, $500,000 in a Fidelity Investments account, $245,814 in a Coinbase account, and $6,825,089 in his personal bank account.  In a deal announced by the Department of Justice, Alvi pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, taking responsibility for $14 million worth of fraudulent HRSA claims. He now faces up to 20 years in prison and will be sentenced on February 7, 2025. The scam has raised concerns about the integrity of COVID-19 testing during the pandemic and the potential misuse of government funds."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-01/lab-owner-pleads-guilty-to-faking-covid-test-results-during-pandemic/">

  <meta name="description" content=" Metro reported continued growth in ridership and ongoing efforts to enhance public safety amidst another high-profile violent crime on its system. In August, the transit agency saw 27,066,446 boardings, reaching 84% of its pre-COVID levels in August 2019. Weekday ridership was 21,187,496 boardings, while weekend ridership was 5,878,950 boardings. Bus ridership increased by 8.2% year-over-year, with weekday ridership at 16,669,840 boardings and weekend ridership at 4,478,018 boardings. Rail ridership also rose by 2.5%, with weekday boardings at 4,517,656.  The agency attributed the increase in ridership to special events such as music festivals, cultural celebrations, and end-of-summer concerts. To improve public safety, Metro officials are implementing a three-point plan that includes increasing law enforcement presence, making station improvements, and adding bus safety measures. Additional security officers have been deployed across the system, and Metro Transit Security Bus Safety Teams are conducting end-of-line operations during late-night service on busy lines. Ambassadors are also present to assist customers and monitor for any issues.  In summary, Metro is experiencing growth in ridership while simultaneously working to enhance public safety through increased law enforcement presence, station improvements, and bus safety measures. The agency attributes the rise in ridership to special events and concerts, and continues to prioritize the safety and well-being of its passengers."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-01/metro-reports-ridership-increase-despite-recent-incidents/">

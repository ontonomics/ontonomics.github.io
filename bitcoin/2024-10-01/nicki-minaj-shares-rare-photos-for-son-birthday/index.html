The Grammy-nominated rapper expressed her love and gratitude in the caption, acknowledging the joy and new meaning her son has brought to her life. Minaj also touched on the challenges of balancing her career and motherhood, while praising the strength and leadership qualities of her son, who has been compared to the character in the animated film The Boss Baby.

  <meta name="description" content=" In September, the Brazilian government issued Normative Ordinance No 1,475, which blocked operators without a betting license from operating until January 2025. The regulated gaming market is set to launch on January 1, 2025. By the deadline, 89 operators had been approved, allowing 193 brands to legally operate in Brazil. Notable brands like Bet365, Betsson, and Aposta Ganha were included, but some significant names in the sector, such as Caixa Loterias, Esportes da Sorte, VaideBet, and Zeroumbet, were not.

  <meta name="description" content=" Prairie Operating Co., a Houston-based company, has expanded its presence in the Denver-Julesburg (D-J) Basin by acquiring assets from private equity-backed E&amp;P Nickel Road Operating for $84.5 million. The deal, announced in January, included 5,592 net leasehold acres, 26 producing horizontal wells, and 89 well permits in Weld County, Colorado. The initial cash purchase price was reduced to $84.5 million, along with other closing adjustments.  The acquisition was funded through a private placement of common stock, an equity facility, and cash on hand. Prairie formed last year through the merger of Creek Road Miners Inc., a company using stranded gas assets for cryptocurrency mining, and Prairie Operating, which focuses on oil and gas asset development.  Since acquiring the Exok acreage and announcing the Nickel Road deal, Prairie has been working on obtaining drilling permits for its initial  Genesis  assets. The company began drilling in September, with the first well of an eight-well pad on its Shelduck South development. The eight-well pad will feature 2-mile laterals in the Niobrara B and C Chalks, with drilling expected to be completed by late October.  Prairie s Chairman and CEO, Edward Kovalik, expects the production from the Shelduck South development and permitted Genesis locations to provide a significant cash flow engine for growth through 2025 and beyond. The company s stock was trading up 6% at $9.03 per share near midday on October 2, with a market value of approximately $111 million.  Prairie s executive team has several ties to Delaware Basin E&amp;P Rosehill Resources, with previous leadership roles in KLR Energy, EPL Oil &amp; Gas Inc., and KLR Group. The company s acquisition of D-J Basin assets from Nickel Road Operating is part of its ongoing expansion strategy in the region."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-02/prairie-operating-gets-output-acreage-boost-from-nickel-road-m-a/">

  <meta name="description" content=" Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, is enhancing business payment methods by introducing the use of stablecoins, such as the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin. This development was announced in a news release on October 3rd, where Coinbase Prime, a brokerage platform, facilitated the payment of invoices from PayPal to EY (Ernst &amp; Young). The platform supports trades, custody, and prime services.  Steven Capozza, Coinbase Director of Institutional Sales, highlighted the growing interest from Fortune 500 companies in exploring crypto payments, with many transitioning from proof-of-concept to full adoption. Stablecoins offer faster, cheaper, and more efficient B2B payments and treasury management due to their instant settlement, including across borders. They also provide rewards to holders, improving workflows for companies and their vendors.  PayPal Director of Market Development, Steve Everett, emphasized the benefits of digital currencies like stablecoins, which enable 24/7 payments, near-instant fund transfers, and near-real-time settlement. This allows businesses to utilize their funds more efficiently.  The news also follows Coinbase s previous announcement of the first-ever crypto transaction between two AI agents, as stated by CEO Brian Armstrong. AI agents, which cannot obtain bank accounts, can now use stablecoins on Coinbase Prime to transact with humans, merchants, or other AIs. These transactions are instant, global, and free.  Armstrong invited companies working on AIs and large language models to integrate Coinbase s crypto wallet for payments. He also suggested that companies selling services should prepare for AI-enabled checkout.  Overall, Coinbase s expansion of stablecoin usage in business payments aims to improve efficiency, speed, and global reach, while also benefiting companies and their vendors through rewards and enhanced workflows."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-03/coinbase-widens-access-to-crypto-b2b-payments/">

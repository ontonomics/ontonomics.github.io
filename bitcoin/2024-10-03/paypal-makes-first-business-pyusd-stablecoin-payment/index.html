  <meta name="description" content=" PayPal has successfully completed its first business payment using its in-house stablecoin, PYUSD, to accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. This transaction, which was conducted on September 23, showcases the potential of digital currencies to streamline commercial transactions. The stablecoin, launched in 2023, is pegged to the U.S. dollar and operates on an SAP SE platform.  Stablecoins have gained prominence in the FinTech world due to their stability, as they are designed to maintain a stable value, unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, which are known for their price volatility. This stability makes stablecoins ideal for various financial applications. FinTech companies worldwide have recognized the benefits of stablecoins, as they offer the advantages of digital currencies without the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies.  The U.K. s Revolut is reportedly working on creating its own stablecoin, while PYUSD has become one of the largest stablecoins globally, with a market capitalization exceeding $715 million as of Thursday afternoon.  By bypassing traditional banking systems and intermediaries, stablecoins can lower transaction costs and settlement times. This feature is particularly appealing for FinTechs aiming to improve global payments. The user experience of using stablecoins for cross-border payments can be likened to using Venmo, where recipients instantly receive funds in their chosen currency.  Sheraz Shere, GM payments and commerce at Solana Foundation, emphasizes that blockchain solutions and stablecoins are more about FinTech than cryptocurrencies. He believes that these technologies have found product-market fit in cross-border payments, offering a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional banking systems."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-03/paypal-makes-first-business-pyusd-stablecoin-payment/">

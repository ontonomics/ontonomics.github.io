  <meta name="description" content=" In 2023, the Baltimore Peninsula, formerly known as Port Covington, was undergoing significant transformation. The area, which was once an industrial site, was now being redeveloped into a mixed-use area with commercial office buildings, residential townhouses, and retail spaces. The buzz of construction activity and the variety of uses suggested that the area would come into its own in 2024.  The townhouses of Locke Landing, named after the Locke Insulator Company, were a notable feature of the redevelopment. The former industrial site, which had run 15 kilns and employed 500 workers at its peak, was now home to a tightly packed townhome community. The new developments also included luxury townhouse units on the Patapsco waterfront.  The area was set to undergo another major change with the relocation of Under Armour employees from their Tidepoint location to a new headquarters building designed by Gensler. The building featured sustainable design elements and a retail outlet for the public to access UA gear. The company would also use the athletic field for testing sports apparel and make it available to the community.  Office occupancy for Baltimore Peninsula was reported to be at 40 percent leased as of July, with a diverse range of tenants including a health care startup, a cryptocurrency firm, and a dining venue operated by the Clyde’s Restaurant Group.  The redevelopment of Baltimore Peninsula was led by MAG Partners and MacFarlane Partners, who had the opportunity to write the next chapter for this significant stretch of Baltimore s real estate. Their efforts would create another transformation of the city in ways not imagined at the start of the 21st century.  Joe Nathanson, a retired principal of Urban Information Associates, has been writing a monthly column for The Daily Record since 2001.

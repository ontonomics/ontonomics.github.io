  <meta name="description" content=" The vice-presidential debate between J.D. Vance and Tim Walz, hosted by CBS News, attracted 43.15 million viewers across 15 networks, marking a 25.2% drop from the 2020 debate s 57.92 million viewers. This viewership figure could disappoint those who bet on the total on Polymarket, as the odds for 40 million to 45 million viewers stood at 14%, with a combined 32% chance of drawing 45 million or fewer viewers.  The 2024 debate s viewership fell below the historical average of 46.5 million viewers for the last 11 debates (1976-2020), with the most-watched debate in 2008 between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin attracting 69.9 million viewers. The 1996 debate between Al Gore and Jack Kemp had the lowest viewership at 26.6 million.  The majority of the viewers came from the Big Four broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox) and the three largest cable news outlets (CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC). CBS had the highest viewership with 9.57 million viewers, followed by Fox News (7.93 million), ABC (6.35 million), and NBC (5.67 million).  The media networks could benefit from the upcoming  60 Minutes  election special airing on October 7, featuring an interview with Harris. Fox, despite not hosting its own debates, performed well with its simulcast broadcasts on Fox News and the Fox broadcast channel.  In summary, the vice-presidential debate between Vance and Walz attracted 43.15 million viewers, falling below the historical average and potentially disappointing those who bet on higher viewership figures. The majority of viewers came from the Big Four broadcast networks and the three largest cable news outlets, with CBS as the likely winner due to its high viewership. The upcoming  60 Minutes  election special could also benefit media networks."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-03/vance-vs-walz-here-how-many-people-watched-vp-debate-paramount-global-nasdaq-para/">

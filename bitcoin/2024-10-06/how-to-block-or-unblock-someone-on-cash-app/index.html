  <meta name="description" content=" Cash App has simplified the process of blocking and unblocking users on both Android and iOS devices, thanks to the widespread use of smartphones and NFC chips. The popular virtual payment app offers various features like user-to-user payments, investments, a debit card, and Bitcoin. However, users may need to block someone due to scams or other issues.  To block a user on Cash App, open the app and select the Activity tab at the bottom of the home screen. Tap the profile icon of the user you wish to block, and select  Block  at the bottom of their profile. The blocked user can no longer make transactions with you, send or receive messages, find you by searching for your Cashtag, or appear in your contacts list. Additionally, your transaction history with the blocked user is deleted, and they won t be notified that they ve been blocked.  To unblock a user, follow similar steps. Open Cash App, select the Activity tab, and tap the profile of the blocked user in your transaction history. Choose  Unblock  at the bottom of their profile. The user will now be able to interact with you again in the app.  Blocking a user on Cash App is a private choice, and they are not notified of the block. However, they won t be able to make transactions with you, send or receive messages, find you by searching for your Cashtag, or appear in your contacts list. Your transaction history with the blocked user is also deleted, even if you unblock them.  In summary, Cash App provides an easy and straightforward process for blocking and unblocking users, ensuring a safer and more secure experience for its users."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-06/how-to-block-or-unblock-someone-on-cash-app/">

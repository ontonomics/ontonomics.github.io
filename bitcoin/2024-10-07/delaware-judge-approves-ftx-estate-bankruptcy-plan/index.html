  <meta name="description" content=" The primary conclusion from the article is that the ability of the exchange to repay its customers is attributed to the liquidation of investments made by FTX and Alameda, the increase in crypto prices since the exchange s collapse, and the estate s clawback efforts.  When John J. Ray III assumed the role of CEO from Sam Bankman-Fried, the exchange s financial situation was dire, with only a small fraction of the cryptocurrency owed to customers remaining. At that time, there were only 105 bitcoins (valued at approximately $17,000) left on the exchange, while nearly 100,000 customers had deposited their cryptocurrency.  The exchange s recovery and capacity to repay its customers are now largely due to the liquidation of investments made by FTX and Alameda. One significant investment was an 8% stake in the AI startup Anthropic, which was sold for $884 million. This substantial sale has contributed to the exchange s ability to settle its debts.  Additionally, the dramatic rise in crypto prices since the exchange s collapse has played a crucial role in its recovery. The increase in value of the cryptocurrencies held by the exchange has provided a significant boost to its financial position, enabling it to repay its customers more effectively.  Lastly, the estate s clawback efforts have also contributed to the exchange s ability to repay its customers. The estate has taken steps to recover assets and funds that were previously mismanaged or misappropriated, further strengthening the exchange s financial standing.  In summary, the exchange s ability to repay its customers is a result of the liquidation of investments, the rise in crypto prices, and the estate s clawback efforts. These factors have combined to improve the exchange s financial situation, allowing it to settle its debts and fulfill its obligations to its customers. &lt;|end|&gt;"/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-07/delaware-judge-approves-ftx-estate-bankruptcy-plan/">

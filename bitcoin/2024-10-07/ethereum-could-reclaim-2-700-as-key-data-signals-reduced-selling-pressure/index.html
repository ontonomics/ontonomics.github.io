  <meta name="description" content=" Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading below its local highs at around $2,448, facing resistance at the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) and the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA). The market is closely watching ETH s ability to reclaim these key levels, as failure to do so could lead to a deeper correction towards the $2,200 area. Conversely, breaking above these levels could signal a bullish trend reversal and a potential surge toward the $2,700 resistance area.  On-chain data from Glassnode indicates a decline in Ethereum inflows into exchanges, suggesting that investors are holding onto their assets rather than selling. This trend typically points to increased accumulation and could foreshadow a bullish breakout. The decrease in exchange inflows could signify that traders are positioning themselves for a potential upward movement, as they seem more inclined to retain their holdings during this crucial phase.  The broader crypto market is anticipating a massive rally following the Federal Reserve s decision to cut interest rates. However, despite the optimistic outlook, Ethereum prices have struggled to climb higher, leaving many investors on edge. The reduction in selling pressure, as suggested by the Ethereum Exchanges  Net Position Change indicator, could improve market sentiment and pave the way for a potential ETH rebound.  Traders and investors are closely monitoring Ethereum s price action and on-chain metrics for signs of a resurgence. If Ethereum can capitalize on the improved sentiment and regain upward momentum, it may set the stage for a bullish breakout and a test of higher price levels.

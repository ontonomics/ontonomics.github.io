  <meta name="description" content=" The main conclusion from the article is that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey has approved a bankruptcy plan for the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, which will use its recovered assets to fully repay customers and potentially provide $1 billion in seized assets to shareholders.  FTX, a crypto exchange that faced collapse in November 2022, has managed to recover billions in assets since its downfall. The company had $12.6 billion in assets in June, but this figure could increase to $16.5 billion after the firm completes its asset recovery and sales.  The recovery includes the sale of a majority stake in the AI startup Anthropic for $884 million, as reported by CNBC. The firm s creditor attorney, Ken Pasquale, acknowledged the benefit from the bull crypto market during the exchange s collapse.  In addition to repaying customers, FTX s preferred shareholders could receive $1 billion from seized assets, including $626 million from the sale of co-founders Sam Bankman-Fried s and Gary Wang s shares of Robinhood. Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of fraud, is serving a 25-year prison sentence.  FTX s bankruptcy plan aims to provide 98% of creditors with 118% of their allowed claims, while others will receive 100% of their claims. The total value of the exchange s assets, once converted to cash and distributed, is expected to be between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion.  In summary, FTX s bankruptcy plan approved by Judge Dorsey will use the company s recovered assets to repay customers and potentially provide $1 billion in seized assets to shareholders. The firm s recovery efforts have led to an increase in its asset value, and the plan aims to satisfy creditors  claims while ensuring a fair distribution of the available funds. &lt;|end|&gt;"/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-07/ftx-shareholders-could-get-1-billion-in-seized-assets-report/">

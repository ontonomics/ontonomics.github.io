  <meta name="description" content=" The cryptocurrency market is anticipating a significant event as Optimism (OP), Aptos (APT), and Taiko (TAIKO) prepare for token unlocks collectively valued at $169.66 million. This week s activity will see a substantial release of tokens across these three major projects, potentially amplifying the prevailing selling pressure due to increased supply. Aptos leads the unlocks with nearly $100 million worth of APT tokens set to be released, followed by Optimism and Taiko.  Token unlocks refer to the release of previously locked or vested tokens during a cryptocurrency s launch, which can be traded on the market, often leading to increased liquidity. However, a sudden surge in supply can cause price volatility as recipients may decide to sell, exerting downward pressure on prices. New buyers often serve as exit liquidity for early investors, team members, or project developers who receive these unlocked tokens.  The upcoming unlocks, particularly from Aptos, Optimism, and Taiko, could have profound effects on the price of cryptocurrencies. Taiko s unlock is deemed most critical, as a larger portion of its circulating supply will be unlocked in a single event, potentially dramatically influencing its price action. In comparison, Aptos and Optimism will see smaller portions of their total circulating supply unlocked.  Investors, especially retail investors, should monitor these unlocks closely as they could bear the risk of liquidity once the unlocked tokens are sold or reduced. The unlocks could lead to price drops, as seen in Optimism s case. Overall, the token unlocks could significantly impact the cryptocurrency market, and investors should be cautious in their decision-making. &lt;|end|&gt;"/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://ontonomics.com/bitcoin/2024-10-07/optimism-aptos-and-taiko-face-169-66-million-in-token-unlocks-should-you-buy-or-sell/">

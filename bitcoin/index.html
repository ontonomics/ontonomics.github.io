    <br/> Banks are preparing to conduct cryptocurrency transactions on the Swift network, reflecting the growing trend of tokenization in the financial sector. The Swift network, operated by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), is set to facilitate the settlement of digital assets and currencies. This development comes as financial institutions increasingly embrace the use of digital tokens to represent real-world assets.  Next year, pilot programs will commence, allowing banks to test the feasibility and efficiency of using the Swift platform for crypto transactions. The move towards tokenization is driven by the need for more secure, efficient, and transparent financial systems. By leveraging the Swift network, banks can potentially enhance their ability to manage and process digital assets, while also benefiting from the established security and reliability of the platform.  The integration of cryptocurrencies and tokenization into traditional banking systems represents a significant shift in the financial industry. As banks explore the potential of digital assets, they must also address challenges such as regulatory compliance, cybersecurity, and interoperability with existing financial infrastructure. The successful implementation of crypto transactions on the Swift network could pave the way for a more seamless and integrated financial ecosystem, where traditional banks and digital asset platforms can coexist and collaborate.  In summary, banks are gearing up to trial crypto transactions on the Swift network as the industry s shift toward tokenization accelerates. This development highlights the growing importance of digital assets in the financial sector and the need for innovative solutions to support their integration into traditional banking systems. Pilot programs are set to begin next year, marking a significant step forward in the evolution of the financial industry.

    <br/> The HBO documentary, directed by Cullen Hoback, aims to reveal the true identity of Bitcoin s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, a mystery that has persisted since Bitcoin s creation in 2009. The documentary could have significant implications for global financial markets and the U.S. presidential election, particularly due to Donald Trump s support from Bitcoin enthusiasts. Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptocurrency, has gained prominence among those wary of traditional currency and has been used in illegal activities.  Nakamoto, who disappeared in 2010 after helping launch Bitcoin, has been the focus of numerous investigations, with suspects like Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, and Craig Wright being named over the years. However, no definitive proof has emerged. Wright s 2016 attempt to claim Nakamoto s identity ended in controversy and legal issues.  Many Bitcoin enthusiasts believe that Nakamoto s identity should remain private unless irrefutable evidence, such as transferring coins from Nakamoto s known wallet, is presented. The HBO documentary is expected to reignite debates surrounding this financial enigma. The documentary will air next Wednesday at 2 a.m. CET (9 p.m. EST on Tuesday).

    <br/> Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, is enhancing business payment methods by introducing the use of stablecoins, such as the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin. This development was announced in a news release on October 3rd, where Coinbase Prime, a brokerage platform, facilitated the payment of invoices from PayPal to EY (Ernst &amp; Young). The platform supports trades, custody, and prime services.  Steven Capozza, Coinbase Director of Institutional Sales, highlighted the growing interest from Fortune 500 companies in exploring crypto payments, with many transitioning from proof-of-concept to full adoption. Stablecoins offer faster, cheaper, and more efficient B2B payments and treasury management due to their instant settlement, including across borders. They also provide rewards to holders, improving workflows for companies and their vendors.  PayPal Director of Market Development, Steve Everett, emphasized the benefits of digital currencies like stablecoins, which enable 24/7 payments, near-instant fund transfers, and near-real-time settlement. This allows businesses to utilize their funds more efficiently.  The news also follows Coinbase s previous announcement of the first-ever crypto transaction between two AI agents, as stated by CEO Brian Armstrong. AI agents, which cannot obtain bank accounts, can now use stablecoins on Coinbase Prime to transact with humans, merchants, or other AIs. These transactions are instant, global, and free.  Armstrong invited companies working on AIs and large language models to integrate Coinbase s crypto wallet for payments. He also suggested that companies selling services should prepare for AI-enabled checkout.  Overall, Coinbase s expansion of stablecoin usage in business payments aims to improve efficiency, speed, and global reach, while also benefiting companies and their vendors through rewards and enhanced workflows.

    <br/> Gary Gensler, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has appealed a 2023 ruling that imposed restrictions on cryptocurrency trading. This decision has led to a significant drop in the value of XRP, with the cryptocurrency experiencing a 10% decline. The SEC s appeal, as reported by BenzingaCryptocurrency and Bloomberg, has further intensified the ongoing dispute over the regulation of digital assets.  The SEC s ruling, which was initially aimed at curbing potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies, has been met with criticism from Ripple Labs, a company that develops and maintains XRP. The company argues that the decision has only prolonged the  complete embarrassment  for the agency, as it continues to grapple with the complexities of regulating the rapidly evolving crypto market.  The appeal by the SEC has added to the uncertainty surrounding the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. The agency s stance on XRP and other digital assets has been a point of contention, with some arguing that it has been overly cautious and restrictive. This has led to a decline in investor confidence and a drop in the value of XRP, which has been a popular choice for traders and investors in the crypto market.  The ongoing dispute between the SEC and Ripple Labs highlights the challenges faced by regulators in keeping up with the fast-paced development of the cryptocurrency industry. As the market continues to grow and evolve, it is likely that more disputes and regulatory challenges will arise. The outcome of the SEC s appeal could have significant implications for the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States, and potentially set a precedent for other countries as they grapple with similar issues.  In summary, Gary Gensler s SEC has appealed a 2023 ruling that restricted cryptocurrency trading, leading to a 10% drop in XRP s value.

    <br/> Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, is investigating potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Iris Energy Limited (IREN) due to allegations of materially misleading business information. The firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses, with no out-of-pocket fees or costs for potential claimants through a contingency fee arrangement.  Investors are encouraged to join the class action by visiting the Rosen Law Firm s website or contacting attorney Phillip Kim. The firm has a strong track record in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation, having secured hundreds of millions of dollars for investors in the past.  The investigation stems from a report by Culper Research, which criticized IREN s business claims and noted a significant drop in its stock value following the report. Rosen Law Firm advises investors to select qualified counsel with proven success in securities class actions, as many firms issuing notices may lack comparable experience or resources.  For updates and more information, follow the Rosen Law Firm on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Contact details for the firm and its attorneys are provided for potential claimants to join the class action.  Note: Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.

    <br/> The final phase of the cryptocurrency bull market was characterized by exceptionally high sale prices for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, the global interest in NFTs has significantly waned, with the crypto market now shifting its focus towards memecoins, which are cryptocurrencies associated with internet memes and humor. This shift in enthusiasm reflects the evolving landscape of the crypto industry, as seen in a story published on CoinDesk on October 3, 2024.  The once-booming NFT market, which saw unique digital assets being traded at exorbitant prices, has experienced a decline in popularity. This change in trend can be attributed to several factors, including market saturation, regulatory concerns, and a growing realization of the speculative nature of NFTs. As a result, investors and enthusiasts have started to explore alternative crypto products that offer a more lighthearted and entertaining experience.  Memecoins, short for  meme coins,  have emerged as a popular alternative to NFTs. These cryptocurrencies are often associated with internet memes, popular culture references, and humorous content. The appeal of memecoins lies in their ability to tap into the collective consciousness of the online community, creating a sense of camaraderie and shared amusement among users.  The rise of memecoins can be seen as a reflection of the broader trends in the crypto market, where innovation and novelty continue to drive interest and investment. As the industry evolves, it is likely that new forms of crypto products will emerge, catering to the ever-changing tastes and preferences of the global crypto community.  In conclusion, while the NFT market may have reached its peak during the last cryptocurrency bull market, the crypto industry has shifted its focus towards memecoins, which offer a more whimsical and entertaining experience for investors and enthusiasts. This change in trend highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and its ability to adapt to the evolving tastes and preferences of its users.  Reference: CoinDesk, 2024-10

    <br/> PayPal has successfully completed its first business payment using its in-house stablecoin, PYUSD, to accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. This transaction, which was conducted on September 23, showcases the potential of digital currencies to streamline commercial transactions. The stablecoin, launched in 2023, is pegged to the U.S. dollar and operates on an SAP SE platform.  Stablecoins have gained prominence in the FinTech world due to their stability, as they are designed to maintain a stable value, unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, which are known for their price volatility. This stability makes stablecoins ideal for various financial applications. FinTech companies worldwide have recognized the benefits of stablecoins, as they offer the advantages of digital currencies without the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies.  The U.K. s Revolut is reportedly working on creating its own stablecoin, while PYUSD has become one of the largest stablecoins globally, with a market capitalization exceeding $715 million as of Thursday afternoon.  By bypassing traditional banking systems and intermediaries, stablecoins can lower transaction costs and settlement times. This feature is particularly appealing for FinTechs aiming to improve global payments. The user experience of using stablecoins for cross-border payments can be likened to using Venmo, where recipients instantly receive funds in their chosen currency.  Sheraz Shere, GM payments and commerce at Solana Foundation, emphasizes that blockchain solutions and stablecoins are more about FinTech than cryptocurrencies. He believes that these technologies have found product-market fit in cross-border payments, offering a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional banking systems.

    <br/> The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under Chair Gary Gensler, has a robust agenda for 2024, with over 70 rulemakings targeted, compared to 43 under previous chairs. The agenda includes modernizing the Regulation National Market System (Reg. NMS) and the Alternative Trading System (ATS) regime, enhancing cybersecurity and privacy controls, and expanding the scope of activities requiring registration.  The SEC has already made significant progress, including expanding definitions for dealers and government securities dealers, enhancing order execution disclosures, and modernizing privacy and cybersecurity obligations for covered institutions. The agency also plans to adopt proposals for new Regulation Best Execution, a proposed new Order Competition Rule, and new Exchange Act Rule 6b-1.  The SEC intends to expand the meaning of what constitutes an exchange, potentially impacting crypto platforms and communication protocol systems. The SEC also plans to amend Reg. SCI to include new requirements for covered entities and adopt new cybersecurity requirements for market entities.  Additionally, the SEC expects to repropose rules related to broker-dealer and investment adviser conflicts of interest in the use of predictive data analytics, artificial intelligence, and similar technologies.  The SEC s agenda is ambitious, with many rulemakings expected to be adopted by the end of 2024. However, the timing may be affected by the upcoming presidential election and potential changes in leadership. The Congressional Review Act  lookback  also adds an element of uncertainty for the SEC and industry participants.

    <br/> The U.S. economy continues to grow due to fiscal spending, robust corporate earnings, and consumer spending. The Federal Reserve s recent monetary policy loosening is expected to further boost growth. However, there are concerns about a potential bump in inflation in the fourth quarter, with September s CPI data possibly marking the low for the current inflation cycle.  Wall Street anticipates further interest rate cuts, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has cautioned against automatic expectations of rate reductions at every meeting. The Fed remains data-dependent and is wary of rapid rate cuts given the strong economy and wage levels.  The risk of stagflation, characterized by rising inflation, unemployment, and slowing growth, is a concern if inflation indicators rise while job losses continue. A declining currency, slowing growth, stubborn inflation, and easing monetary policy could spark worries among economists and investors.  Investors may find better performance in dollar equivalents like gold and silver, commodities like copper, emerging markets, and Bitcoin. Equity sectors such as utilities, technology, energy, industrials, and consumer discretionary are expected to outperform, while financials, telecom, and consumer staples may underperform.  Investment styles like secular growth, momentum, mid-cap stocks, low beta, and quality are expected to outperform, while small caps, dividend plays, value, and defensives may underperform. Fixed-income areas like Municipal bonds, long-dated bonds, and TIPS are recommended, while avoiding preferred, convertible bonds, high-yield credit, and leveraged loans.  Predicting the economy and inflation is challenging, and the focus on expected rate cuts and presidential elections may overshadow developments in December. The future economic environment may indicate more of the same unless populist demands are resolved quickly.  Bill Schmick, a Berkshires columnist, advises caution and suggests considering assets and investment styles that perform well in stagflation-like conditions. However, he warns that predicting the economy and inflation is difficult, and

    <br/> The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is appealing a federal court s decision regarding Ripple, a prominent cryptocurrency. This legal dispute has significant implications for the cryptocurrency market and Ripple s operations.  The SEC filed a notice of appeal in a case against Ripple, which has been a subject of contention between the two parties. The court s ruling in question pertains to the classification of XRP, Ripple s native digital asset, as a security or not. The SEC has argued that XRP should be treated as a security, which would subject it to regulatory oversight and potential penalties for non-compliance.  Ripple, on the other hand, has maintained that XRP is not a security but a utility token, which would exempt it from SEC regulations. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching consequences for the broader cryptocurrency industry, as it may set a precedent for how other digital assets are classified and regulated.  As the SEC appeals the court s ruling, the deadline for filing the appeal is approaching. The decision on whether the SEC will continue to pursue this case remains uncertain, but the outcome could have a significant impact on Ripple s business operations and the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.  This legal battle has already caused volatility in the cryptocurrency market, with XRP experiencing a notable decline in value. The resolution of the SEC s appeal against Ripple will likely continue to influence market sentiment and investor confidence in the cryptocurrency space.  In summary, the SEC s appeal of a federal court s ruling on Ripple s XRP cryptocurrency has created uncertainty in the market and raised questions about the future of cryptocurrency regulation. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for Ripple, the broader cryptocurrency industry, and the regulatory landscape in the United States.

    <br/> In 2023, the Baltimore Peninsula, formerly known as Port Covington, was undergoing significant transformation. The area, which was once an industrial site, was now being redeveloped into a mixed-use area with commercial office buildings, residential townhouses, and retail spaces. The buzz of construction activity and the variety of uses suggested that the area would come into its own in 2024.  The townhouses of Locke Landing, named after the Locke Insulator Company, were a notable feature of the redevelopment. The former industrial site, which had run 15 kilns and employed 500 workers at its peak, was now home to a tightly packed townhome community. The new developments also included luxury townhouse units on the Patapsco waterfront.  The area was set to undergo another major change with the relocation of Under Armour employees from their Tidepoint location to a new headquarters building designed by Gensler. The building featured sustainable design elements and a retail outlet for the public to access UA gear. The company would also use the athletic field for testing sports apparel and make it available to the community.  Office occupancy for Baltimore Peninsula was reported to be at 40 percent leased as of July, with a diverse range of tenants including a health care startup, a cryptocurrency firm, and a dining venue operated by the Clyde’s Restaurant Group.  The redevelopment of Baltimore Peninsula was led by MAG Partners and MacFarlane Partners, who had the opportunity to write the next chapter for this significant stretch of Baltimore s real estate. Their efforts would create another transformation of the city in ways not imagined at the start of the 21st century.  Joe Nathanson, a retired principal of Urban Information Associates, has been writing a monthly column for The Daily Record since 2001. He can be contacted at [email protected]

    <br/> The vice-presidential debate between J.D. Vance and Tim Walz, hosted by CBS News, attracted 43.15 million viewers across 15 networks, marking a 25.2% drop from the 2020 debate s 57.92 million viewers. This viewership figure could disappoint those who bet on the total on Polymarket, as the odds for 40 million to 45 million viewers stood at 14%, with a combined 32% chance of drawing 45 million or fewer viewers.  The 2024 debate s viewership fell below the historical average of 46.5 million viewers for the last 11 debates (1976-2020), with the most-watched debate in 2008 between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin attracting 69.9 million viewers. The 1996 debate between Al Gore and Jack Kemp had the lowest viewership at 26.6 million.  The majority of the viewers came from the Big Four broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox) and the three largest cable news outlets (CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC). CBS had the highest viewership with 9.57 million viewers, followed by Fox News (7.93 million), ABC (6.35 million), and NBC (5.67 million).  The media networks could benefit from the upcoming  60 Minutes  election special airing on October 7, featuring an interview with Harris. Fox, despite not hosting its own debates, performed well with its simulcast broadcasts on Fox News and the Fox broadcast channel.  In summary, the vice-presidential debate between Vance and Walz attracted 43.15 million viewers, falling below the historical average and potentially disappointing those who bet on higher viewership figures. The majority of viewers came from the Big Four broadcast networks and the three largest cable news outlets, with CBS as the likely winner due to its high viewership. The upcoming  60 Minutes  election special could also benefit media networks.

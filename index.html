        <h2>&#34;Daily Cryptocurrency Digest: Axie Infinity Gains, U.S. Blockchain Regulation Advances, and Ethereum ETF Updates&#34;</h2>
        <p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Digest! Here, we bring you the latest news about digital currencies. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced investor or just starting, we&rsquo;ve got something for you. Let&rsquo;s look at the main events from the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Axie Infinity&rsquo;s trading value went up by 1.1% against the US dollar. Its market cap is now $1.14 billion, and the token is priced at $7.86. Axie Infinity started in October 2020 and keeps attracting investors. To trade AXS, people usually buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first and then use exchanges like GDAX or Gemini.</p>
<p>The DPET token had a small drop in value against the US dollar, with a market cap of $2.06 million. This token offers a gaming experience with DeFi features for NFT collectibles. DPET is the main currency for trading, breeding, and battling monsters in the game. Investors often buy Ethereum or Bitcoin first to trade DPET.</p>
<p>Ardor&rsquo;s value went down by 1.5% against the US dollar, with a market cap of $101.02 million. Launched in 2017, Ardor uses a proof-of-stake system and offers a scalable, multi-chain blockchain service. Investors usually buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first to get Ardor on platforms like Gemini or Coinbase.</p>
<p>Horizen&rsquo;s value dropped by 1.2% against the dollar, trading at about $9.67. Despite this, it saw a 4% increase over the past week. With a market cap of $145.45 million, Horizen offers a scalable platform for creating public or private blockchains. Investors often buy Bitcoin or Ethereum first to trade Horizen.</p>
<p>The week of May 19-25 saw big steps in U.S. blockchain regulation. Important events included bipartisan approval of the FIT 21 Act, Uniswap&rsquo;s response to an SEC Wells notice, and possible approval of an Ether spot ETF by the SEC. These events show growing political support for digital assets, highlighted by Consensus, the largest industry conference. The House also passed a comprehensive crypto law, despite opposition from the President and SEC Chair. These advancements show increasing bipartisan support for the crypto industry, though challenges remain in Senate approval and ongoing SEC enforcement actions.</p>
<p>Ethereum ETFs are expected to get only 20% of the flows seen by Bitcoin ETFs, similar to Silver compared to Gold. Hashdex withdrew its ETH ETF application due to SEC filing issues. Ethereum may trade sideways until ETF approval. Volatility Shares 2x Ether Strategy ETF will launch on June 4, tracking double the price of ETH. Approval of ETH leveraged futures ETF suggests the SEC may have eased concerns about Ethereum&rsquo;s security. Vitalik Buterin discusses Layer 2 benefits for the Ethereum ecosystem. ETH price may stay around $3,800 until ETF approval, with potential to rise past $4,093 with positive ETF news.</p>

<p>The world of digital currencies is changing fast, with big market movements and new regulations shaping the landscape. Understanding these changes can help you make smart decisions about your investments and the future of digital finance.</p>
<p>Public opinion plays a key role in the success of digital currencies. For example, when Tesla said it would accept Bitcoin as payment, the price went up, showing increased public confidence. On the other hand, when China announced a crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, the market dropped significantly. These examples show how public opinion can greatly affect market dynamics.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates, and happy investing!</p>
